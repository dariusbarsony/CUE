"7PREFACE
The international Crossroads project connects European 
cultural heritage as it emerged between AD 300 and 1000. 
In this project, different narrative contexts are explored in 
terms of continuity, change and entanglement, taking into 
consideration the effects of the converging pagan and  
Christian influences as the transition was made into a pre -
dominantly Christian society which transformed the Early Middle Ages. The exhibition is presented through specially selected museum objects, displayed thematically, and differ -
ent media such as an interactive interpretative mapping tool, the cross-culture timeline.
Never before were so many people adrift in and around 
Europe as in our time. On the other hand, migrations, cli -
mate change, emerging religious communities and shifting markets were in fact well-known phenomena between 300 
and 1000. We should not romanticise these past develop -
ments, but looking at the past can help us put our own chal -
lenges in perspective or incite us to open up to the different perspectives that we can distinguish. Which brings us to the  
core of this project: diversity and connectivity. 
Both in this publication and in the Crossroads exhibition,  
the different regional identities and their development over 
time and space come to the fore. Early-medieval society was 
diverse, multilayered and constantly changing — a complex 
world full of energy and ambition. We see people looking  
for support or safety, for trading contacts, expertise or know -
ledge, and for fortune or booty. In one way or another, peo -
ple were connected.
The stories of the travellers in this book illustrate the con -
nectivity of the Early Middle Ages. These travellers in a way embody the curiosity that is the driving force of our muse -
ums, collections, visitors and staff. Travelling in place and time shows us diverse societies and hopefully keeps us  curious about the other(s).This major European exhibition is part of the Connecting Early-Medieval European Collections (CEMEC) project, which was funded by the Creative Europe Programme of  
the European Union (Creative Europe, EACEA Agency).  
We want to thank the lenders of this exhibition, all the part -
ners in this project, the authors of this publication, and the members of the Editorial Board for their support and input, 
which the exhibition team and the designers have shaped 
into an evocative exhibition and publication. Through our 
cooperation and with their support we can show a new per -
spective on a part of European history. It is our hope that the 
power of diversity and connec  tivity, the two themes of both 
the exhibition and this publi  cation, will provide the diverse 
perspectives that are a means  
to grow respect and strive for peace.
This publication is volume 7 in the Allard Pierson Museum 
Series, which is published in cooperation with WBOOKS. 
Crossroads has been realised with help from the Mondriaan Fund, the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds and the Friends of 
the Allard Pierson Museum.  
Crossroads is also the second result of a collaboration be  -
tween a number of European museums sharing the same DNA. The partners in the COBBRA network (in Copenha -
gen, Oxford, Bonn, Brussels, and Amsterdam) will keep working together, exchanging expertise, colleagues and  
collections, and organising travelling exhibitions to show 
our respect for the ancient and medieval world as well as its relevance for our own.

PREFACE"
"8 CROSSROADSThis publication presents the Early Middle Ages as a 
period of transformation when cultural exchange was 
reflected in the development of different regional cul­
tures in Europe from Ireland to the Mediterranean, from 
the Baltic to Greece and Spain. The overarching themes 
of connectivity and diversity give shape to individual 
elements such as the heritage of the ancient Roman Em ­
pire, the effects of travel and the impact of war, the rep­resentation of identity and the connection of know  ledge 
and faith as Jewish, Christian and Muslim groups coex­
isted, reflecting the cohesive nature of Europe in the 
Early Middle Ages. 
From the fourth to the eighth century, external forces 
caused a reshaping of the Roman Empire. Most signifi­
cantly the Huns appeared out of the east, causing great 
social upheaval. Germans were on the move as well, en ­
tering the Roman Empire from the west and playing an important role in the empire’s internal conflicts, which 
caused destabilisation for decades. This migration recon­
figured the old West Roman Empire and created a fright­
ening momentum with successive waves of horsemen 
from the east rolling in. Between 636 and 642 the East Roman or Byzantine Empire lost its most productive  
and fertile provinces — Egypt, Syria, and Palestine — to 
the Arab armies. It was the start of a spectacular west­ward advance of Islam that was blocked at both ends of 
Europe: by the Franks in Poitiers and by the Byzantines 
in Constantinople. In the North we see that around  
the North Sea and Baltic Sea trading networks began  CROSSROADS

MUDEJAR  STYLE
Following the Umayyad conquest 
of Hispania, al-Andalus became one of the leading cultural and economic centres in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Islamic world. The Real Alcazar (Royal  Palace) in Seville, Spain, was built as a fort by Abd al-Rahman III in 91 3, on the site of former Roman and Visigoth forts, and was later developed as a palace in the  1 1th–1 3th centuries. It was built  in the so-called mudejar  style,  
a combination of Arab and Euro -
pean architecture, and is listed  as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Green marble column with  Corinthian capital from the Roman period, in the main courtyard of the Real Alcazar at Seville.
SPOLIA > 
The Palatine Chapel in Aachen was built by Charlemagne between 796 and 805, after the model of contemporary Byzantine buildings. The original Carolingian throne came from the spolia (spoils of war) 
of the Church of the Holy Sepul -chre in Jerusalem. The upper- gallery openings are divided by  ancient Roman columns that had earlier been reused in a church  in Cologne. Charlemagne had  further spolia brought to Aachen from Rome and Ravenna. "

"10 CROSSROADSto re­establish from the sixth century onward and many 
centralised markets emerged. Exotic items were travel­
ling all over Europe, reflecting the amazingly wide ex ­
change networks.In the ninth and tenth century Europe was rebalanced  
in several ways. This period showed a turmoil of migra­
tions and ended with a patchwork of polities that led to 
an era of state formation in western Europe. The concept 
of the Early Middle Ages is of course a Western Euro­
pean concept that does not reflect the eastern part of  
the Roman Empire, which continued to flourish and 
showed a remarkable resilience that deeply influenced 
European history. 
With the archaeological evidence and material culture  
of this period we try to envisage the intriguing and 
sometimes astonishing recovery of societies and com­munities in an age of change. The Crossroads exhibition, 
which will travel to other cites in Europe as well, ex ­
plores different narrative contexts relating to aspects  of continuity, change and entanglement, taking into consideration the effects of the converging pagan and 
Christian influences, as the transition was made to a  full Christian society which transformed the Early Mid­dle Ages. The exhibition is presented through different 
media of specially selected museum objects exhibited 
thematically, combined with a mapping of the objects  on a digital panoramic timeline as an interactive inter ­
pretative tool.As a general rule the Roman Empire is synonymous 
with the homogeneous Graeco­Roman culture which 
was characterised by distinct administrative structures,  
a highly developed infrastructure, and with Latin as the 
official language that was spoken all over the Empire as  
a connective element across this vast landscape. This is 
LONG-DISTANCE TRADE
This necklace, found in Mecken -
heim (Germany), testifies to  
long-distance trade. Interspersed between the glass beads are am -
ber beads from the Baltic and a bead from the shell of a thorny  oyster ( Spondylus gaederopus ) from the Aegean. Thorny oysters were traded in Europe as early as the Late Neolithic (c.4500 BC). Glass, amber, copper alloy, thorny oyster, Meckenheim (Germany), AD 550–650.SYNCRETISM 
In Late Antiquity and the Early Mid -
dle Ages, rituals and symbols from 
various religions were freely com -
bined into new forms that we often find surprising. Sometimes this syncretism was a conscious effort, but usually it grew organically from daily practice, and worshippers rarely had problems with it.

"11 CROSSROADS: TRAVELLING THROUGH EUROPE, AD 300– 1000MIGRATION
The Early Middle Ages are a  
period of migration. The Longo -
bards were on the move through Europe over several centuries.  The Huns appeared in Europe  in the first half of the 5th century,  followed by the Avars c. 555.  The Avars drove the Longobards  to Italy and extorted tribute from the Byzantine Empire. In 6 26  they made an alliance with the  Sassanids and attacked Constan -
tinople; having failed to take the city, the Avars lost their dominant position and became a mere re -
gional power. Gold short-stemmed cup from an Avar male grave found in Bócsa (Hungary), h. 1 6.7 cm,  AD 6 25–650.THE BLUE QUR’AN
The ‘Blue Qur’an’ is one of the 
most famous works of Islamic  calligraphy, dating from the late 9th or early 10th century. It is writ -
ten in gold and decorated in silver on vellum (calfskin parchment)  coloured with indigo, probably  emulating the purple parchment used for Byzantine imperial manu -
scripts. In the 7th century, much  of the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East was conquered by Arab armies that followed the trade and communication routes. 
totally different from the standard image of the Early 
Middle Ages, the so­called Dark Ages. Was it really so 
dark? This is one of the key questions in the exhibition 
Crossroads: Travelling through Europe, AD 300–1000.  
It also asks questions regarding aspects of diversity and regionalism, and whether there were connecting ele­
ments during this period and if so, what impact they had.
The unifying content has been identified in the form of 
ten exemplary travellers who migrated and moved 
around Europe, such as Ohthere, who gave a matter ­ 
of­fact account of his travels to the North Cape, the  Kola Peninsula and Ireland; Theophano, the Byzantine 
princess who came to the West to marry an Ottonian "
"12 CROSSROADSem peror; and Ibn Fadlan, the Arab diplomat who left  
us an unrivalled report on the culture of steppe peoples 
and ancient Russia. These journeys provide connections 
within the vast land mass of Europe as tales from pil­
grims, scholars and merchants delineate routes and 
adventures, bringing to life the reality of travel in the 
Early Middle Ages. 
In AD 802 the Jewish merchant Isaac returned from the 
court of the Caliph Harun al­Rashid in Baghdad after a 
two­year journey, bringing an elephant to the palatinate 
of Charlemagne in Aachen. Baghdad under the rule  
of the Abbasid dynasty (AD 750–1258) was one of the 
most important cultural centres in the world. Aristotle’s 
works on logic and other ancient works in Classical 
Greek, Byzantine Greek, Pahlavi, New Persian and  
Syriac were translated into Arabic there. In Francia the 
Carolingian Renaissance was flourishing, a renovatio of 
antique heritage. In Constantinople during this time the 
Empress Irene was in power. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes (d. AD 818) tells us that Charlemagne after his coronation as emperor intended to marry Irene, as 
the planned marriage between Charlemagne’s daughter 
Rotrude and Irene’s son Constantine failed. As a result, 
the empire of Charlemagne would have been accepted in 
the East. The validity of Theophanes’ narration is ques­
tionable, but it demonstrates how close the communica­
tion of the ruling empires of East and West was at the 
time.
HIDDEN TREASURE
This Carolingian hoard of 73 
coins, 2 fibulae, a belt end and a bead was discovered at Muizen (near Mechelen, Belgium) in 1 906. It may have been buried when the Vikings sailed up the Flemish rivers. Muizen is not far from Leuven, where a Frankish army led by Arnulf of Carinthia  defeated the Vikings in 891. One  of the coins in the hoard is an Arab dirham. Silver, c. AD 884.

These finger rings were made from 
solidi  of the Byzantine emperor 
Phocas (r. 602–6 10). They were made in a Byzantine workshop  and found separately in Western Germany, attesting to diplomatic and/or trade contacts between  the Frankish and Byzantine em -
pires.Gold, diam. 1.7 and 2.8 cm,  AD 603-650, Kobern-Gondorf  and Brühl-Vochem (Germany).
In European history, the development of the cultural 
patrimony of the Early Middle Ages is viewed as a com­
plex process bound up with internal forces and external 
influences that took place during the period from AD 
300 to 1000. The connective approach of using a time­
line as a cipher tool enables the historical process to be 
rationalised in terms of periodisation. The exhibition 
carries several overlying themes, which aim to create a 
linear stratigraphy. The first runs from AD 300 as Late 
Antiquity gave way to the post­Roman period, with a 
consequent thematic discourse on the issue of ‘Heritage 
and Memory of Rome’. This in turn initiates an internal 
discussion that draws on objects and historical imagery 
to represent the classical world of Greece and Rome and 
the transformation, emerging out of Egypt and Byzan­
tium, as objects became entangled and separated from 
their original symbolic meanings. This line of question­
ing supports a break with classical tradition and is the­matically heralded to link in to the period of the Great Migration in Europe from the fifth to the seventh cen­
tury AD. 
The second theme, ‘Knowledge’, discusses the quicken­
ing pace of change across Europe as literacy spread and 
offered new perspectives in the wake of the new mission 
of Christianisation, starting from Ireland. 
With the formation of key dynasties, kingdoms and hi ­
er    archic societies in the Merovingian, Carolingian and 
Ottonian domains from the eighth to the tenth century 
AD, ‘Identity’ is a central focus as the art objects in the 
exhibition are presented to reflect and represent these 
new humanistic associations. Different social groups 
identified themselves through artistic imagery, with the 
aid of patronage from varied monarchical, tribal and sei­
gnorial governments that commissioned art to validate 
their authority. In time, artistic creativity would enhance 
ecclesiastical ceremonies with rich visual imagery, and 
the associated material culture would provide a visuali­
sation of cultural anthropology that imbues the Euro­
pean cultural patrimony.  
The integration of ‘Faith’ follows directly as a key topic 
in the exhibition as the religions of Judaism, Christianity 
(the dominant religion in most of Europe) and Islam are 
reflected in the development of different regional cul­
tures in Europe — notably Spain, whose models came 
from the heart of the Muslim world in Syria, Arabia and Iraq, and acquired a unique Andalusian flavour in artistic 
forms and trade networks, with a cultural exchange of 
iconography and objects. The increased mobility caused 
by far ­reaching ‘Travel and Trade’ would in turn pro­
mote new discourses in contemporary sources and is 
represented in the exhibition by objects that acquired 
new stories along the latitude and longitude of trade 
routes, as travel increased the interaction and ‘globali­
sation’ of European cultural assimilation. 
From northern regions, Viking incursions effected  
strategic change by planting new settlements in coastal 
regions and along the major rivers. The impact of this 
new wave of migration from the margins to the centre  
of Europe would be noted in terms of intellectual impact 
on the Holy Roman Empire from the ninth century AD 
as a major renovatio gained momentum. Monastic re  ­
forms were implemented as the many contemporary sources connected political, economic and social devel­
opments. Furthermore the impact of ‘Warfare’ was felt 
as increasing waves of instability swept through this 
long period from the ninth to the eleventh century AD, "
"causing interruptions in artistic productivity and devel­
opment. The exhibition concludes with an overview of a 
shared cultural history and presents the changing nature 
of European cultural heritage and identity. 
In Crossroads: Travelling through Europe, AD 300–1000, 
the Early Middle Ages are viewed through the lens of the 
relationship between art and identity and its impact on 
the formation of European cultural heritage. In this con­
text, the relationship is explored between historical 
events as seen in terms of the themes of faith, identity 
and representation, knowledge, literacy and language; 
trade and travel; historical consciousness and warfare; 
and authenticity, as frontiers and landmarks changed  
and gave way to underlying nostalgia and memory. 
These separate issues are portrayed as cohesive entities 
in the course of the developing European history. 
We chose the thematic approach in order to enable ac­ 
cess to ways of transcending national and local idioms, 
to demonstrate the cosmopolitan nature of the cross­
cultural European story as enlightenment. Themes 
emerge through the mirror of mobility, connectivity

This painting is part of a series de -
picting the rise and fall of an imagi -

with the decline and destruction of Rome, especially the sack of the city by the Vandals in 455. Modern scholarship however tends to stress that Rome’s downfall was a long process mainly caused by internal power struggles and corruption.

which binds together the overarching methodology, 
which focuses on regional case studies in the artefacts 
drawn from across Europe as each object represents and 
was connected to a specific social group and a place. Most 
significantly, the theme of Identity provides us with a 
greater range of access to historical, ethnographic and 
innovative interdisciplinary sources, which help us to 
identify with the past and its connectivities throughout 
the expanding European narrative."

"18The ‘Dark Ages’ is the name typically used to describe the 
years AD 300–1000, but it tragically obscures the rich cul -
tural diversity of the era and the great transformation that took place. Although traditional views posit that the ‘Fall of 
Rome’ occurred in AD 47 6, change began earlier; between 
AD 235 and 385, for instance, no less than twenty-two indi -
viduals claimed to be the emperor of the Roman Empire. In addition to the political instability, people living in the third century AD saw shifts in belief, daily life, and even their envi -
ronment. As a result of these conditions, this period is often perceived to be a time of fragmentation, isolation, and vola -
tility. Ancient sources, and indeed modern imaginations, cast the years following AD 300 as the time of ‘Romans’ and 
‘Barbarians’. 
 From AD 300, different groups of people  —  characterised  
in Greek and Roman sources as gentes  or ethne  —  gained 
prominence. These groups interacted, came into conflict, and travelled. They may have been identified as ‘Barbarian’ 
groups in Roman and older Greek sources, but this does not 
help us to understand the culture, art, and history of these 
people. After all, the term ‘Barbarian’ originates from the 
sound that a non-Greek-speaking person appeared to utter 
(i.e. barbarbar). In the sources that use this term, it was not 
necessarily used negatively; some Greeks extolled the learn -
ing and virtue of the ‘Eastern Barbarians’ (the Phoenicians, 
Egyptians, and Persians) and the third-century philosopher 
Plotinus, for instance, went to the East specifically to learn. 
Most ancient sources however do not provide as much 
nuance where foreigners are concerned. The Vandals, Goths 
and Huns, for instance, are often viewed as violent and unen -
lightened; today, these names are still synonyms for violence and destruction.
Although it is hard to argue that the Early Middle Ages were a time of peace, there is much more to these groups than  
pillaging. The groups that arose at various points during this 
period  —  not just the Vandals, Goths and Huns, but also the 
Franks, Longobards, Avars, Merovingians, Copts, Irish and several others  —  all had rich individual cultures. Within these cultures, unique expressions can be found in their clothing, art, weapons and warfare, burial practices, forms of religion, social structures, power, knowledge, and ways of relating to 
their Roman (and non-Roman) pasts. The years 300 to 
1000 thus were not solely a period of upheaval and change; 
they also fostered the continuation of religious, artistic, and 
political institutions. This can be seen in how individual 
groups did or did not adopt Christianity or Islam, began or 
continued practices of pilgrimage and monasticism, came 
into conflict or lived in peace, used existing art forms and 
discovered new ones, and interacted with old and new  neighbours in Europe and beyond. 
The story of how cultures developed and changed ‘after 
Rome’ is an essential part of early-medieval history. The  
following chapter outlines how several cultures developed in 
the years 300 to 1000, beginning with the successor states 
that materialised following the collapse of Rome. The move -
ment of the capital to Constantinople and the rise of the Byz -
antine Empire is an important part of the narrative that will help set the scene for changes in culture, political adminis-
tration, and religion in this period. The cultural domain of al-
Andalus (Islamic Iberia) in AD 700–1000 demonstrates 
cultural and religious integration, and the importance of 
trade networks in this time. Egypt and its multicultural at- 
mos  phere made up of Copts, pagans, Jewish communities 
and early followers of Islam is understood through the rich 
material culture that has been preserved. In the North, the Irish and their insular and interconnected role will be exam -
ined along with technology and exploration of the Vikings and Kievan Rus in the Baltic. The chapter concludes with the 
Migration period (AD 400–700), exploring the history,  
culture, and diversity of people that made up the Franks,  
the Slavs, and the Avars.  
Rather than a ‘Dark Age’ filled with isolated ‘Barbarian’ groups, the early-medieval period was a time of rich cultural 
diversity.<< ROMAN WORLD MAP

"21fortunate. Although the evidence is archaeological and 
indirect, there is no sign at all that the previously pros­
perous villa­owning classes of Late Roman Britain and 
north­western Gaul survived the political transforma­
tions of the fifth century to form part of the new elites of 
the Early Middle Ages. More generally, the accommoda­
tions documented elsewhere came about only because 
the immigrant dynasties annexed so much of the West­
ern Empire’s tax base in the mid­fifth century that its 
central authorities were no longer able to maintain suffi­
ciently powerful armed forces to keep the state in being. 
This placed provincial Roman landowners in an acutely 
vulnerable position. Their status was based on landed 
wealth which the empire’s legal structures defined and 
protected. Its collapse put the security of those holdings 
in doubt, leaving Roman landowners with no choice but to make accommodations where they could. Even if, as 
was usually the case, those accommodations cost them 
part of their landed wealth, this was still better than los­
ing everything, as happened to the Roman landowners 
of Britain and north­western Gaul.JUSTINIAN

"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY22Nevertheless, the dismantling of the empire in the west 
still left important interest groups in place in whose out­
look key elements of traditional Roman culture played a 
structurally defining role. For the next 150 years, the 
eastern half of the Roman Empire, centring on Constan­
tinople (modern Istanbul, Turkey), continued to loom 
over the emerging successor states. Much more powerful 
than any of them, it exercised cultural and sometimes 
political hegemony over at least parts of the western 
Mediterranean. A second important group consisted of 
provincial Roman landowners, who survived in sub­
stantial numbers outside of Britain and north­western Gaul. A classical education in Latin language and litera­
ture was a central element in their cultural formation, 
fundamental to their claim — as a class — to represent a 
perfected, rational version of humanity, willed into being as part of the Divine plan for the Cosmos. The 
third broadly ­Roman interest group was the Christian 
Church. The scholarly literature still tends to concentrate on the Christianisation of the Roman world in the late 
Imperial Age, looking at how engagement with the new 
imperial religion transformed classical traditions, struc­
tures, and values. At least as important, however, was 
the simultaneous Romanisation of Christianity. In the 
process, numerous elements of classical culture helped transform different dimensions of Christianity as what 
had been a small sect of the highly devout was remade 
into a mass imperial religion. Amongst other things, 
Greek philosophy underwrote a defining stage in the 
development of Christian doctrine, the standard prac­
tices of classical grammarians helped expound Christian 
religious texts in exciting new ways and transformed 
developing sermon styles, and centuries­old iconogra­
phic patterns helped create a ‘new’ Christian art.
None of these three sources of Romanitas survived the 
fall of the Western Empire untouched. Provincial Ro ­
man landowning elites had customarily purchased an expensive education for their children from professional 
teachers of Latin language and literature — grammarians 
(who could be found in every market town of the Em ­
pire) — because speaking perfect classical Latin marked 
out their elite status, but also because it was the sine qua non for the highly lucrative civilian careers in Late Ro ­
man central and local government. The simpler institu­tional patterns of the post­Roman West, combined with 
its competitive political fragmentation as kingdom regu­larly fought kingdom, put a much greater premium on 
military service, with the result that the vast majority 
even of Roman­descended members of the successor ­
state elites had evolved into warrior aristocrats by the middle of the sixth century. In this context, an expensive 
literary education no longer played any structural role in 
elite lifestyles, and grammarians — who had provided 
cultural continuity since the first century AD — progres­
sively went out of business across the Roman West. 
Individual families provided their children with a sim­
plified version of the old education, with mothers appar ­
ently playing a critical role, and post­Roman elites cus­tomarily learned to read but not to write, and had much 
less exposure to Latin literature.  GERMANIC BROOCH WITH BYZANTINE

This Germanic brooch seems to 
imi     tate images of Byzantine em -
presses with a high head-dress.  On the other hand there is Roman imagery as well: the circle of gold leaf imitates a Late Roman coin showing Roma Invicta (Invincible Rome, an ancient Roman motto that in Late Antiquity was used to prop up the failing empire’s mo -
rale). It is thought that this imagery was then Christianised and in this case, the female figure might well be the Virgin Mary. The brooch was probably worn by a wealthy woman to close her cloak.

"23As a result, classical Latin slowly evolved into different 
dialectical forms of early Romance as the full linguistic 
apparatus of the grammarian — cases, moods, and ten­
ses — fell out of day ­to­day use, even if the cultural 
cachet of literary accomplishment remained powerful. 
The gram marian­trained Italian poet Venantius Fortuna­
tus found huge popularity, for example, in the now grammarian­less Gaul of the later sixth century. The list 
of his patrons shows not only that the taste for classicis­
ing literary forms remained strong here, despite the dis­
appearance of high­level Latin teaching, but also that the 
Roman­descended component of the new Frankish 
kingdom’s elite had managed to transmit classical tastes 
to the Frankish peers with whom they were now in ­
creas ingly intermingled at the courts of the Merovingian 
kings.
For the Church, too, the end of the Western Empire  
heralded major change. In practice, the Church had been 
relying on grammarians to generate a well­educated 
epis   copate since the last quarter of the fourth century. 
As the grammarians disappeared, therefore, the sixth CHARLEMAGNE 
Charlemagne was crowned emper -
or by Pope Leo III on Christmas 
Day 800. Charlemagne under -
stood his imperial authority to have come directly from God, so that he had the authority and the duty,  after the example of Late Roman emperors, to reform the Church. His coronation is commemorated in this fresco by Raphael (1 483–1 520), in the Apostolic Palace  in the Vatican. It is likely that the  fresco also refers to the Concordat of Bologna, negotiated between the Holy See and France in 1 5 1 5, since Leo III is in fact a portrait of Leo X and Charlemagne a portrait of the French king Francis I.
FROM CONSTANTINE TO CHARLEMAGNEcentury saw a plethora of local initiatives (such as those 
of Cassiodorus and Martianus Capella) to create new cur ­
ricula for a Christian education along with collections of the necessary texts. But the overall outcome was again 
substantial cultural fragmentation. In practice, the 
Church’s intellectual heritage was distributed over a 
series of local centres, none of which preserved the 
whole, while churchmen, too, suffered from the general 
diminution in classical standards of Latinity, with texts 
written or copied in the sixth and seventh centuries 
increasingly displaying non­classical orthography and 
grammar. This was accompanied by a parallel institu­
tional fragmentation, because the central authority  
figure in the Christian world of the fourth and fifth cen­
tury had in fact been the Roman emperor. He alone had 
the right to call the general (ecumenical) councils of the 
Church, at which many of the evolving doctrines and 
practices of the new imperial Church had been ham­
mered out. Groups of churchmen continued to develop 
religious practice at councils in the post­Roman West, 
but on a kingdom­by ­kingdom basis, with only Gallic "
CROSSROADS DIVERSITY24
"25bishops attending councils in the Frankish Kingdom, 
and Hispanic bishops their counterparts in the Visi   go th­
 ic kingdom, etc. As a result, the post­Roman Western 
Church broke up into a series of kingdom­based com­
munities which often maintained quite diverse religious 
standards even on such fundamental points as baptism. 
All of these communities drew on inherited Roman  
traditions to some extent, but developed them in their 
own ways, so that the overall pattern of Roman survival 
in practice was one of fragmentation and dilution.
Nonetheless, some defining elements of Romanitas 
became integral to the evolving cultural norms of the 
early ­medieval West. The official Roman imperial ver ­
sion of Christianity — as defined at the ecumenical  
Councils of Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381) — 
even   tually won out as the standard orthodoxy across  
the en  tire  ty of the post­Roman West. This should not  
be taken for granted. In c. AD 500 the monarchs of the 
Ostrogothic, Visigothic, Vandal­ Alan, and Burgundian 
kingdoms were all Arian Christians, subscribing to a more hierarchical view of the Trinity where the Son was 
subordinate to the Father which Nicaea and Constantin­ople had overturned, and the effective founder of the 
Merovin gian Frankish kingdom, Clovis, was tempted to 
convert to this alternative definition of faith. That a non­imperial form of Christianity did not in the end prevail 
can be attributed to the influence of the surviving secular 
and religious West Roman elites , who uniformly sub­
scribed to Nicene Orthodoxy — stressing the equality of 
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — and the power and pres­
tige of the rulers of Constantinople who held the same 
view. Clovis formed an alliance with the Eastern Empire 
against particularly the power of the Gothic rulers of 
Italy, Spain and southern Gaul. Then, in the reign of Jus­
tinian (r. 527–565), East Roman armies eliminated the Ostrogothic and Vandal­ Alan monarchies of Italy and 
North Africa while Clovis’s sons destroyed the inde­pendent Burgundian kingdom in the 530s, to swing the 
balance so dramatically in favour of Nicene orthodoxy 
that the Visigothic monarchy eventually converted from 
Arianism at the Third Council of Toledo in 589. It was 
only natural, therefore, that when the Anglo­Saxon 
kings of southern Britain were eventually converted to 
Christianity from the last decade of the sixth century, 
they too embraced Roman, Nicene orthodoxy.
Soon after AD 600, massive losses of territory first to 
the Persians, and then definitively to Islam, reduced the 
Empire of Constantinople from global superpower to 
eastern­Mediterranean regional power and eliminated it 
as a major continuing support for Romanitas in the 
West. By this time, moreover, some important defining 
characteristics of the old Roman state structure had dis­
appeared across the West, above all the economic and 
fiscal complexity which had allowed the empire to main­tain professional armies and the extensive governmental 
bureaucracies so beloved of its landowning elites. As a 
result, the Western successor states were not simply 
geographically smaller versions of the Roman Empire, 
but adopted a new, more limited form of state organisa­
tion based on little taxation and non­professional armed 
forces composed of warrior aristocrats. Fiscal and eco­
nomic simplicity also shows in the smaller scale of their 
public works (both for defence and prestige). Nonethe­
less, the key conduits of Romanness internal to the post­
Roman West — landowning elites of Roman descent 
and the Nicene Church — managed to inculcate several 
principal Roman ideas into the heart of the emerging 
world order.
Above all, the central claim of Roman state ideology that 
rulers were appointed by God to maintain a divinely ­
ordained, utterly superior social order on earth was uni­formly adopted. Visigothic, Frankish and other successor 
kings were not just secular rulers, but claimed real reli­
gious authority too. That is the fundamental reason why 
post­Roman Western Christianity operated on a king­dom­by ­kingdom basis, since its various kings inherited 
from Roman emperors the power to call Church councils (and appoint bishops), and only a king’s own bishops 
would come to his councils. In Late Roman political ide­
ologies, the existence and operation of written law was 
seen as the fundamental proof that imperial society had  
a unique claim to be part of the Divine Plan for the Cos­
mos, and this, too, was inherited throughout the Roman MONASTERY
The great imperially sponsored 
monasteries, such as St Gall, and the schools established in the households of the archbishoprics and greater bishoprics of Charle -
magne’s empire were the intellec -
tual centres where classical Latin was restored and through which a common stock of key texts built up a real unity in the western Church for the first time since the fall of Rome. This map, showing church -
es, houses, workshops, stables, an infirmary and a brewery, was long considered the official model of  a Carolingian monastery. In the 20th century herb gardens were created next to churches following its example. Parchment, 1 1 3 x 78 cm, c. AD 820.
FROM CONSTANTINE TO CHARLEMAGNE"
"26West. The kings of many first­generation successor 
states (particularly the Visigoths and Burgundians) 
directly continued Roman legal patterns for ideological 
as well as practical reasons, while subsequent moments of Christian conversion or renewal were often accompa­
nied by the issuing of some kind of law code (even in 
Anglo­Saxon England) as monarchs staked their claim to 
be ruling divinely ordained and therefore fully legiti­
mate societies.
Also in accordance with inherited Roman tradition, 
Latin, if increasingly in the diluted, fragmented form of 
quasi­Romance dialects, nonetheless remained the pri­
mary language of all Western churchmen. And, despite 
much practical day ­to­day separation, churchmen in the 
different realms also managed to maintain some sense of 
overall unity. This was assisted, paradoxically, by the rise 
of Islam, because its dismantling of Eastern Imperial 
power facilitated the emergence of an independent 
Papal Republic in the early eighth century and the con­
sequent reorientation of the papacy towards the West 
after a century of being dominated by the personnel and 
agendas of Greek ­speaking Eastern Christendom. But 
the papacy exercised no formal authority outside Rome at this point, and this reorientation achieved little di  rect 
effect in the short term beyond generating a few reques­ted clarifications (particularly from Anglo­Saxon mis­
sionaries) of traditional Christian practice. What really 
maintained a sense of community at this point was the 
periodic exchange of texts. By the early eighth century 
separate collections of Visigothic and Frankish conciliar 
decisions, the forty ­two papal letters collected by Dio­
nysius Exiguus, and the same author’s translations of the canons of the Late Roman ecumenical councils were 
widely available across the former Roman West, provid­ing a base for common practice — even if local church 
communities carried on making further decisions at their own kingdom’s councils without formally consult­
ing one another.
By 700, the Latinity of the Western Church, its Nicene 
orthodoxy, and a loose sense of Christian religious com­
monality were well­established features of the early ­
medieval West: all cultural elements with a strong Ro ­
man heritage. A vision of kings as God­appointed rulers with a duty to maintain a social order that was uniquely 
in tune with the Divine Will was a shared feature of 
Western political thinking, as was the understanding 
that written law was the essential reflection of such a 
legitimate socio­political order: both again reflect the power of the common Roman heritage, and both even spread east of the Rhine into regions that had been be ­
yond the old imperial frontier. In some ways, the influence of this Roman heritage be­  came still more marked over the next century as succes­
sive members of the Carolingian dynasty united most 
post­Roman Latin Christendom under its direct control 
(the Anglo­Saxon kingdoms remained independent, and 
the bulk of Spain fell to Muslim conquest). Charle­
magne’s imperial coronation on Christmas Day 800 
symbolised the revival of a decidedly Roman vision of 
imperium — not merely in title but in substance as well. 
The emperor had also initiated a huge reform project (renovatio), funded from the proceeds of his many con­
quests, which had done much to remedy the fragmenta­
tion of western Europe’s still­powerful Roman heritage. 
The manuals of the old Roman grammarians were dus­
ted off to reassert the primacy of classical Latin as the 
language of the Church, and a canon of necessary texts —  
Christian and others — was defined, assembled, recop­
ied, and distributed to a group of major episcopal and 
monastic libraries at which the new standards would be 
maintained and then spread further over the coming 
generations. Charlemagne ruled practically the whole of 
Latin Christendom, and a sequence of councils and re ­
form initiatives (in the preparation of service books, for 
instance) generated much greater practical Christian reli­
gious uniformity across the Latin West. And all of this 
was done at the command of Carolingian emperors, not 
of Roman popes, again reflecting genuine Late Roman 
traditions of overarching imperial religious authority. 
Factor in, as well, that both Charlemagne and his succes­
sors placed an increasing emphasis on the importance  
of written law as the practical and symbolic heart of or  ­
dered government, and the influence of Late Roman her ­
itage in the formation of Carolingian rule becomes ex ­
traordinary.
At the same time, it is important to remember how 
much had changed. Classical Latin was revived, but 
largely for churchmen. The secular elites of western 
Europe spoke a variety of vernaculars, and would not be 
customarily trained to read and write in Latin again for 
several centuries. The revival of classical learning was 
also designed to serve rigidly religious purposes: we 
don’t know how many ancient texts stopped being cop­
ied in this period, and hence were lost forever because Carolingian churchmen found no use for them. The em ­
phasis on the importance of written law, in the secular 
CROSSROADS DIVERSITY"
"27realm at least, was more symbolic than practical, and 
quickly died with the swift collapse of the fragile Caro­
lingian Empire, which lacked the economic and institu­
tional foundations that had made its Roman predecessor 
so extraordinarily long­lived. Again, it would be the 
twelfth century, when both secular Roman lawyers and 
papally ­centred canon lawyers systematised old and 
rather disparate text traditions in Bologna and Pavia, resolving contradictions by analytical commentary, 
before practical Roman­type legal patterns were re­
established across western Europe in both secular and 
religious contexts, in the process establishing the  
practical power of the Roman papacy as the head of 
western Christendom for the first time. Charlemagne 
inherited many of the ideological agendas of his reign 
from his Roman imperial predecessors, but they were being deployed to rule a completely different kind of state in a thoroughly transformed socio­political and 
economic context.THE MEDITERRANEAN, AD 840

Animals from history rarely have an 
entire biography dedicated to them, 
but Abul-Abbas the elephant is an 
exception (see ‘Further Reading’).  
The famous Abbasid caliph Harun  
al-Rashid (r. 786–809) gave him to 
Charlemagne (r. 77 4–81 4) as a pres-
ent. It hardly matters that the animal’s biography is incomplete (there is no 
indication as to where and when he was 
born, for instance): that information  
is not available for many a medieval prince either. What we do know about Abul-Abbas comes from two sources: 
the Carolingian state annals (Annales 
regni Francorum) and Charlemagne’s 
biography, Vita Karoli Magni, by his contemporary Einhard. The elephant is 
not mentioned in Abbasid sources, but 
because of the many references in the 
annals we can be certain that the beast 
existed — which makes him the first 
doc  umented elephant north of the Alps 
since Hannibal. Incidentally, the scanty sources have not prevented even pro -
fessionals from making up additional 
details. An exhibition held at Aachen  
in 2010 was entitled Ex Oriente: Isaac and the White Elephant, while the  
animal’s colour is in fact unknown. 
Abul-Abbas was a diplomatic present. 
Rulers exchanged such gifts as tokens  
of goodwill, but also as a kind of one-
upmanship: offering a unique or pre -
cious gift also meant showing off one’s 
own power and wealth. Those in power 
have always looked for objects, prefera -
bly from their own country or sphere of influence, that could serve as unique 
gifts. The Dutch Republic from the sev -
enteenth century onward used porce -
lain that the VOC (the Dutch East India Company) brought from China; Prus -
sian princes gave amber from the Bal -
tic; the king of Saxony, who had nothing special to offer, had an alchemist locked  TRAVELLER

An alliance between the two superpowers suited them in their conflicts with the Byzantine Empire and the Umayyad Caliphate, which was now ruled from Cordoba in Spain.

From the caliph’s court at Baghdad,  
the elephant and its handler — a Frank -
ish Jew named Isaac — travelled west  
to the Mediterranean and along its south coast, through Egypt and Libya  
to what is now Algeria and Tunisia. 
Charlemagne had been warned by 
messenger that the elephant was on its 
way and sent a fleet to Carthage to pick 
it up. Isaac and Abul-Abbas arrived in 
the vicinity of Genoa in October 801. They spent the winter at Vercelli, south 
of the Lago Maggiore, crossed the  
Alps in spring, and arrived at the 
Aachen imperial residence on 20 July 
802. The long detour south of the  
Mediterranean (the logical route from 
Baghdad to Aachen is through Turkey) 
was made inevitable by the hostile re  -
lations between Harun al-Rashid and 
the Byzantine empress Irene, who con -
trolled what is now Turkey.It appears that Charlemagne was de  -
lighted with his walking present. He sometimes took it with him on military 
expeditions and also used Abul-Abbas 
as a kind of Air Force One — a status 
symbol that often accompanied him on 
his travels from residence to residence, 
enhancing the impression of imperial 
power.An expedition against the Vikings proved fatal to the unfortunate elephant. 
In 810, probably while crossing the Rhine, it caught pneumonia and died, 
again according to the state an-  nals, at 
Lippeham (which probably lay near pre -
sent-day Wesel on the Lower Rhine). 
Charlemagne’s elephant has stirred 
people’s imaginations ever since. When farmers discovered some enor  -
mous bones near Wesel in the eight -
eenth century, scholars from the region 
immediately attributed them to Abul-Abbas. The bones may in fact very well 
have belonged to a prehistoric mam -
moth — but in any case, the story is too 
good to leave out. ELEPHANT

Under Harun al-Rashid Baghdad flourished  as a centre of arts and sciences, but in the West the image of luxury and decadence prevails that cultural critic Edward Said (1 935–2003) has called Orientalism.  His theory is that ever since the Greek play -
wright Aeschylus’ The Persians (472 BC)  Europe has painted a cliché picture of the Middle East as mysterious, decadent and perverse. Thus Harun al-Rashid is mostly known in the West as the caliph from The Thousand and One Nights, the Indian- Persian-Arab frame story in which Scheh -

Italic Longobards (also called Lombards), tells us that on

ran into the Vandals. Preparing for one of the many bat­

"31 THE LONGOBARDS: BETWEEN LOWER ELBE AND ITALYbrothers Ambri and Assi, called upon Wodan to grant 
them victory over their opponents, who at the time were 
still called Winnili (‘warriors’). Wodan replied: ‘I will 
give victory to those I see first at sunrise.’ The Winnili in 
their turn asked the advice of Freya, Wodan’s wife. She 
told them to come out at sunrise; the women should 
undo their hair and wear it around the chin. At dawn, 
Freya turned her husband so that he faced east. He woke, 
saw the Winnili, and asked: ‘Who are these longbeards?’ 
Freya replied: ‘As you just gave them their name, so give 
them victory as well!’ Thus Wodan granted them vic­
tory, and ‘since that day the Winnili have been called 
Longobards’ (Paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardorum  
I, 8). The story must have been told for many generations until it was written down in the eighth century AD.
The earliest archaeological evidence of the Longobards’ 
existence dates from the first century BC. Military pres­
sure by the Romans — who had subjugated several tribes 
in what is now Lower Saxony in AD 4 to create the prov ­
ince of Germania — probably caused single Longobard 
groups to cross the Elbe. In north­east Germany they settled in an area (now the Prignitz) that had been unin­habited for a century. Here, in the town of Hagenow, a 
unique group of graves was found, containing extremely 
rich funeral gifts. Silver spurs, silver belt fittings, weap­
ons and a large quantity of Roman tableware provide us 
with evidence that the Longobards had close connec­
tions with the Roman Empire in the second half of the 
first century AD.
LONGOBARD WARRIOR
Shield fitting in the shape of a 
mounted warrior. It is tempting to connect this artefact with the not-so-peaceful aspects of the Longo -bards’ expansion into the south of Europe; their conquests were often violent. Gilt bronze, c. AD 600, found in Stabio, Switzerland.Already in the middle of the second century AD there is 
a visible decrease in burials on the grave fields on both 
sides of the Lower Elbe. Part of the Longobard popula­
tion had apparently moved on. We can only guess at the 
reasons for their migration: there may have been a con­
nection with the beginning of the Saxons’ moving south 
from what is now Schleswig­Holstein into the northern 
parts of modern Lower Saxony. In AD 166 an army of 
6,000 Longobard warriors invaded Pannonia — a Ro ­
man province south and west of the Danube, present­day west Hungary and parts of, among others, Austria 
and Croatia — as a result of the Marcomannic Wars (166–
180). One would like to connect the migration from the Lower Elbe with this army, but sources are very scarce.
The history of the Longobards over the following two 
centuries is practically untraceable. They may have lived 
in the Bohemian­Moravian region (now in the Czech 
Republic). According to legend, Agilmund from the 
royal line of the Gugings had led them there; he was the 
son of Agios, who had shown his people the way from 
Scandinavia to the continent. Only at the end of the fifth 
century AD do the Longobards resurface in the written sources. After 488 we encounter them in the largely 
depopulated south of Lower Austria; a few years later, 
they also occupy what is now the Marchfeld (Morava 
Field) east of Vienna. It is here that the Longobards be ­
come palpable to us again, with archaeological finds that show a clear connection to central Germany. With the 
Longobards on the Lower Elbe they seem to share only 
their Elbe­Germanic background and their name.
Remarkable finds have been made in north­east Austria: 
the blacksmith’s grave at Poysdorf as well as the graves 
at Hauskirchen and at Maria Ponsee, with its richly deco­
rated horse tack. They introduce us to a society in which 
the warrior took centre­stage. In the Morava area the 
Longobards are subjected by the Herules, another Ger ­
manic tribe, which turns up in the Black Sea region in the third century AD. In 508 however the Longobards in 
a ferocious battle succeed in liberating themselves from "
"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY32the Herules. Led by Wacho, they conquer parts of pres­
ent­day Hungary. Like the famous Ostrogoth king Theo­
deric the Great, whose power extends into the area 
north of the Alps, Wacho consistently secures his reign 
with political marriages: he first marries the Thuringian 
princess Radegunde, then the Gepid princess Austri­
gusa, and finally Silinga, daughter of the defeated Heru­
lian king Rodulph. In 530 he promises his daughter Wi ­
sigarda to the increasingly powerful Frankish prince Theu  debert (r. 533–547/48).
When Wacho dies in 540, Audoin takes over, appoint­
ing himself king after the death of Wacho’s under ­age 
son. The Longobard territory is once more expanded to the south in 547–48. There is a series of changing alli­
ances with the Gepids — a Germanic people living in 
present­day north­east Hungary and Transylvania —  
and the Byzantine Empire under the Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565). The Longobards are increasingly integrated 
into the cultural and political world of the Mediterra­
nean, shaped by the Byzantines. In the grave finds, Medi­terranean folding chairs and bronze basins appear, as 
well as cowry shells from the Red Sea. The Longobards can be recognised archaeologically by the metal accesso­ries and weapons that have been preserved in their 
graves. In men’s graves we encounter a certain type of 
belt buckle and a set of weapons consisting of a long 
sword or spatha, spear and shield. The women’s clothes 
were held in place with four clasps or fibulae, just as  in the Bavarian, Alemannic, and Franco­Merovingian 
territories (see the contribution of Claes and Nieveler).
The rest of Longobard history is connected with the 
name of Alboin (r. after 560–572/73), son of Audoin. As 
conqueror of Italy he is sung in Early Medieval poems 
from Scandinavia to southern Italy: his victories and his 
tragic end supplied excellent material. In the Carpathian A WOMAN’S BURIAL GIFTS

the Longobards: the Gepids. In order to break their 
power, the Longobards made a dangerous alliance with 
the Avars, a tribe of horse­riding warriors from the cen­
tral­ Asian steppe that appeared in the northern Black 
Sea region c.555 just as suddenly as the Huns had done c.400.After the Avars had helped them defeat the Gepids,  
the Longobards came under increasing Avar pressure. 
This dominant ally and the fact that the Longobard  
warriors were looking for fresh spoils forced Alboin to 
take ac  tion. What could he do under the circumstances? 
He undertook an adventure which he knew had once already brought success to another foreign people: the 
conquest of Italy. It was still a rich country, despite the

deposition of the last West Roman Emperor, Romulus 
Augustulus, by Odoacer in 476 and despite the taxing 
wars between Ostrogoths and Byzantines in 535–554. 
More than 5,000 Longobard warriors knew Italy from 
the time when they had been the Byzantines’ allies in 
the war against the Ostrogoths. So Alboin made an 
agreement with the Avars, who were invading the Car   ­
pathian Basin: from then on, the Longobard settlements 
in Pannonia were to be under Avar rule, but for two hun­
dred years the Longobards would retain the right to re ­turn to Pannonia. By giving Pannonia to the Avars, 
Alboin ensured that the Byzantines would not send 
troops to Italy over land. Now nothing stood in the way 
of his plan.
At Easter 568 the army had gathered; as early as May  
568 the Longobard ‘people’ began its march to Italy. It was anything but a closely ­knit ethnic community. The 
sources mention 20,000 Saxon warriors who joined  
the train with their women and children; Gepids, Sarma­tians, Suebi, and even Romance Pannonians took the 
opportunity to move to Italy. This willingness to follow 
Alboin did not just come from the prospect of a new 
home in Italy; Alboin’s charismatic appearance must 
have helped to make so many people join him — be  tween 
100,000 and 150,000. In Italy the Longobards proper are 
clearly recognisable, mostly by the characteristic accesso­
ries described above that are found in their graves.
The Longobards and their companions took part of 
northern Italy almost by surprise. In the two decades 
that followed, they conquered large parts of north and 
central Italy. Unlike the Ostrogoths before them, the 
Longobards had not come as allies of the Eastern Roman 
or Byzantine Empire, but as conquerors. The bloodshed 
as they took the land left no room to doubt this. A deci­
sive factor in the tense relations between the Longobards 
and the Romance (formerly Roman) inhabitants of Italy 
was the fact that the former were not of the Catholic 
faith, but had embraced Arianism. The Catholic monk 
Paul the Deacon describes this doctrine as follows (His­
toria Langobardorum IV, 42): ‘The Arians to their detri­
ment say that the Son is less than the Father and likewise 
the Holy Ghost is less than the Son.’ Particularly in the 
eastern half of the Roman Empire, later the Byzantine 
Empire, the nature of Christ was a source of great spirit­
ual concern for centuries, often leading to quarrels and 
even violent conflict. 
After the conquest of Italy, Alboin’s authority began to 
wane. From 569 onward, bands of Longobard warriors 
led by their dukes (Latin duces, ‘leaders’) operated on 
their own. Some plundered the Provence and Burgundy; 
others moved to central and southern Italy and founded 
independent duchies. Especially the duchies of Bene­
vento and Spoleto were to defy the Longobard kings 
again and again. In 572 Alboin fell victim to a murder 
conspiracy described by Paul the Deacon:
The cause of his murder was as follows. In Verona he had been enjoying himself at a party longer than he 
should have, with the cup in front of him that he’d "
"35LONGOBARD INFLUENCE
It was probably after the Longo -
bard king Authari's marriage to  
the Bavarian princess Theodelinda that the Bavarians adopted a typi -
cal object used in Longobard fu -
neral rites: the gold-leaf cross, which was probably placed on the face of the deceased. Gold-foil cross with a deer in the centre,  an eagle and ornaments in the  so-called Animal Style II, early 7th cent., found in Cividale del Friuli, Italy. had made from the skull of his father ­in­law, King 
Cunimund. He ordered that the queen be given wine 
as well, inviting her to have a merry drink with her 
father (...). As Rosamund heard this, a deep sorrow 
stirred in her heart that she could no longer suppress; 
and she glowed with a desire to avenge her father’s 
death by killing her husband. Soon she conspired 
with Helmechis, the king’s skilpor or shield­bearer 
and foster ­brother, to murder Alboin.  
(Historia Langobardorum II, 28)
The conspirators succeeded in killing the king, but not in usurping power as they had planned. Rosamund fled 
before the Longobard nobles into Byzantine exile. Dur ­
ing an attempt to do away with one of her accomplices, she was killed herself. With Alboin the Longobards bur ­
ied their first king in Italic soil. Alboin’s successor, King Cleph, died after one and a half years; during the ten­
year interregnum that followed, thirty ­five Longobard 
dukes divided Italy amongst themselves. Only when threatened by an alliance of Franks and Byzantines in 
584 did the dukes elect Cleph’s son Authari to be king.The alliance against them, however, was fruitless. After 
proceeding half­heartedly the Franks quickly concluded 
a peace with the Longobards. Authari (r. 584–590) used 
the breathing­space in foreign affairs to eliminate his 
domestic opponents. He did away with collaborators of 
the Byzantine Empire and disobedient dukes, replacing 
them with his own men to consolidate royal power. 
The king was the highest judge and managed his sub­
jects’ tax obligations. To legitimise his claim to power, 
Authari took on the Roman family name of Flavius 
(which be  came part of the Longobard king’s title), plac­
ing himself in the tradition of the Roman emperors of the Flavian dynasty as well as in that of Theoderic the 
Great, who had called himself Flavius Theodericus Rex.
In terms of foreign politics the king secured his position 
by marrying Theodelinda, daughter of the Bavarian king 
Garibald. Numerous Mediterranean import products, 
mostly going over the Alps from Italy, testify to the ex ­
cellent relations between Longobards and Bavarians dur ­
ing this time. Among them are so­called Coptic bronze 
tableware, Mediterranean buckles and earrings, ame­thyst beads and garnets from present­day Sri Lanka, 
India and the eastern Mediterranean; ivory objects from 
Africa, cowry shells from the Red Sea, and much more. 
The Bavarians also adopted a specific object used in  
Longobard funeral rites: the gold­leaf cross. These thin crosses made of gold tin or leaf may have been placed  on the face of the deceased together with a veil.
Authari, who had made numerous domestic enemies, 
probably died of poison in 590. Duke Agilulf of Turin  
(r. 590–615) married Authari’s widow Theodelinda and 
was elected king. He regained lost territory, expanding 
his realm wherever he could and even laying siege to 
Rome. Only an intervention by Pope Gregory I — who 
wrote letters with Agilulf’s Catholic wife, Theodelin  ­  da  — made a truce possible, followed in 598 by a peace 
between the Longobards and Byzantium. While Agilulf 
further consolidated the Longobards’ dominion, Theo­
delinda’s influence led to a conciliation of the Arian con ­
querors and their Catholic subjects. Her son Adaloald  
(r. 616–626) became the first Catholic king, but was de ­
posed when in his conservative compatriots’ opinion  he favoured his own church too much. 
The kings after him were conservative Arians, although 
for instance King Rothari (r. 636–652) was well disposed

towards Catholicism. His victories in domestic and  
foreign politics caused the kingdom to prosper. The  
Longobards’ self­confidence is illustrated by the Edictus 
Rothari of 643, in which Longobard law was codified in 
Latin. Under King Grimoald (r. 662–671) the Longobard 
kingdom reached its greatest size, which with Rome, 
Naples and the Exarchate of Ravenna (exarch: Byzantine 
governor) enclosed almost all of Italy. Grimoald’s suc­
cessor Perctarit (r. 671–688) concluded a definitive peace 
with Byzantium: the Longobards would forgo further 
expansion, while Byzantium gave up on all attempts at reconquest and recognised the Longobards as rulers of 
Italy. This period also saw the final conversion of the 
Longobards to Catholicism, a decision that did much to 
secure Longobard rule over most of Italy for the next 
hundred years. While the political and armed conflicts 
between Byzantium and the Longobard kingdom had 
definitely affected trade, archaeological finds such as 
those from the Crypta Balbi at Rome prove nonetheless 
that there was a lively exchange with the eastern Medi­
terranean. "

les, now known as Charlemagne (r. 768–814). The fragile 
alliance was not to last. When Charles’s brother and fel­
low ­king Carloman died unexpectedly in 771, his family 
fled to Desiderius. Charles, considering his brother’s heirs potential rivals, took offence. Shortly after, Pope 
Adrian I called upon Charles to protect his territory from 
the Longobards, and Charles seized the opportunity. In 773 the Frankish armies marched into northern Italy. Charles took the Longobard capital Pavia in early June 
774; the two­hundred­year reign of the Longobards in 
Italy had ended. On 5 June 774 Charles, ‘Rex Francorum

in Pavia.

AN EASTERN PERS  PEC -
TIVE, AD 400–800

and Anna Pianalto
‘Byzantine Empire’ is the conventional name introduced 
by modern historians to indicate the medieval state cen­
tred on the eastern part of the Roman Empire. It was the 
Christian empire of the East with Constantinople as its 
capital, surviving its Western counterpart to become the 
longest­lived empire with no interruption for over a 
millennium. This paper will attempt to clarify some of 
the reasons for this longevity by analysing a series of 
characteristic artefacts. 
The time frame under analysis spans the period from  
AD 400 to 800, during which the empire underwent 
considerable changes. What happened? After the resto­
ration of Roman supremacy over the Mediterranean Sea 
under the Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565), the northern 
and eastern borders of the empire were attacked by the 
Persians, the Avars, the Slavs and the Arabs until c.800. 
Almost all the eastern provinces were captured by the 
Arabs from 622 onwards. By the time of the Emperor 
Heraclius’ death in 641, the Byzantines were confined to 
their heartland: the regions of Asia Minor with the Ana­
tolian plateau in modern Turkey, the Balkans, Greece, 
parts of Italy and northern Africa. Over the next two centuries the empire lost Africa as well as northern and 
central Italy with Sicily. The situation deteriorated fur ­
ther with climatic changes, reduction of cultivable land (after the significant loss of the grain supply from Egypt 
in 642) and outbreaks of the plague, which resulted in a 
considerable contraction of the empire’s economy. Many "
"39 THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE: AN EASTERN PERSPECTIVE, AD 400–800THE GOOD SHEPHERD
This sculpture is a trapezophoron  
(‘table support’): it once was the 
single leg of a table. It is one of the best-preserved examples of Early Christian art. Christ appears as the Good Shepherd, the guardian of the flock, with two small rams at his feet. The shepherd motif was a pop -
ular theme in Greek art; in Late An -
tiquity sculpture it became associ -
ated with the image of Christ as the Good Shepherd. Marble, h. 47 cm, first half of the 4th century AD.historians assign to the death of Heraclius the end of  
the period called Late Antiquity.
After this significant territorial and economic contrac­
tion, which factors enabled the East Roman Empire to 
survive nonetheless? 
FAITH AND POWER
Firstly, the creation of a Christian community, which 
through different devotional acts such as processions 
and festivals provided a series of opportunities for the 
collectivity to gather and to form a new cohesion. The 
turning point in the East was that this Christian commu­
nity recognised itself within the political ideology struc­
ture of the empire: the ruler, chosen by God, was His 
rep resentative on earth. The provincial and metropolitan 
faithful together with the ecclesiastical community had to be bound to this concept to recognise the emperor as 
their political leader.
In a system where ‘seeing is believing’ this process can be 
traced back as early as the fourth century in archaeologi­
cal evidence. The motif of the Good Shepherd, for exam­
ple, was used in Late Antique sculpture, primarily on 
sarcophagi and table supports. The shepherd as guardian 
of the flock, an iconographic theme popular since the 
Greek Archaic period (e.g. the calf­bearer in the Acropo­
lis Museum), could also be allegorically associated with 
the Christian parable of Christ as the Good Shepherd 
(John 10:11) and Saviour of souls. An interesting exten­
sion of the symbolism of the Good Shepherd comes from a reference in the Greek clergyman and scholar Eu ­
sebius of Caesarea (260–340), according to which the Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 305–337) was the 
good shepherd of his people. The table support depict­
ing the Good Shepherd that is kept in the Byzantine and 
Christian Museum in Athens could reflect the political 
theology of the empire, an earthly emperor chosen by 
God to lead the Christian people. This association of the image with its interpretations was probably not com­pletely acknowledged by all. But this concept of an em ­
peror invested by divine power was also reiterated in coins, the most practical vehicle of ideas throughout  
the empire. As Eusebius stated in his 
Life of Constantine :  
‘He [the emperor] directed his likeness to be stamped  
on the golden coin of the empire with eyes uplifted as  
in the posture of prayer to God: and this money became 
current throughout the Roman world.’ Iconographic 
changes occurred on coins, including the replacement of 
the figure of Nike or Victory with an angel, and the addi­
tion of new symbols such as the cross accompanied by 
angels and saints. Another Christian image appeared on 
the Late Roman coins issued after the death of Constan­
tine the Great in 337: the ruler was received by God,  
represented by His hand. The message of the empire’s 
political theology reached a decisive phase with the coin 
issued during the reign of Justinian II (r. 685–95 and 705–
11) with Christ on the obverse and the emperor on the 
reverse.
SACRED BUILDINGS
The regular gathering of the Christian community in church buildings further contributed to the rise of a  
society based on religious unity. These churches were 
lavishly decorated with sculptures, mosaics and wall 
paintings. An example is the mosaic floor of the Ilissus 
Basilica in Athens decorated with a range of motifs: 
birds, flowers, ivy leaves, rosettes, and so on. The reli­
gious building was not just the community’s meeting 
place but also the receptacle of various liturgical prac­
tices. Churches provided a suitable architectural setting 
for processions, liturgical services, celebrations and  
worship.
The idea of belonging to a Christian community was  
further reinforced by this series of religious practices 
performed throughout the year. More specifically mar ­
tyrs’ cults with their various rituals contributed to the formation and bonding of a Christian community. Reli­
quaries constitute a category of artefacts that shed light 
on this phenomenon. The reliquaries contained martyrs’ 
or saints’ relics and were usually placed under the altar  
of a church during its consecration. Relics of saints were 
associated with major churches as early as the fourth century. These churches attracted believers from all over 
the Christian world who came to venerate the saint in 
question. "

The Ilissus Basilica at Athens was 
one of the beautifully decorated churches that helped cement the Empire’s Christian community. This mosaic panel with a stork pecking at a snake, framed by an elaborate design, was part of a floor decorated with images of ani -mals, plants and geometrical de -
signs. Imagery drawn from natural history is a distinctive characteristic of Byzantine church mosaic floors of the 5th and the 6th centuries. Stone and glass tesserae , first half 
of the 5th century AD.SACRED TRAVEL
Undertaking a journey to the Holy Land represented 
another Christian practice. Pilgrimage was officially pro­
moted under Constantine. Palestine’s landscape with its 
holy places had a particular significance: it was a collec­
tion of key features from the Bible. The pilgrim’s wor ­
ship of God included places, residences and objects that stood for closeness to God. Christians believed that 
these places and objects that had been in bodily contact 
with holy persons became holy themselves. Pilgrims 
wanted most of all to touch, believing that they could 
draw a part of this holiness into themselves. For exam­
ple, the St­Menas flask, containing water or oil from the 
martyr’s crypt, was intended to be worn around the neck 
of the faithful as an amulet for healing purposes. 
SACRED IMAGES
Another religious practice meant to bind Eastern Chris­tendom together was the cult of icons. Icons are painted 
wooden devotional panels representing holy figures and 
scenes from sacred texts. Icons were not an invention of 
Christian art: the Graeco­Roman world already had a 
tradition of displaying images of venerable figures. 
Christian icons however were not common portraits, 
but a medium to communicate with the spiritual world. The wide­open eyes of the represented figures and their 
look invited the worshipper to a personal meeting with 
the divine. Worshippers could address to icons their 
prayers invoking divine intervention in case of natural 
disasters or dangers or more personal requests, and some 
of these icons were believed to work miracles. The fail­
ure of the Avar and Persian siege of Constantinople in 
626 was attributed to such an icon and to the direct in ­
ter  vention of the Mother of God. At the beginning icons 
were found in the domestic sphere; only gradually did 
they make their way into the public and communal 
domain of the church. 
Another reason for the empire’s longevity consists in its 
religious unity. Between 726 and 843, with a brief rest 
between 787 and 815, the empire was troubled by the 
iconoclastic controversy, a severe theological confron­
tation that resulted in a ban on icons. The controversy  
cen   tred on the questions whether sacred figures should 
be depicted or not and whether any kind of worship in front of an icon had to be considered a form of idolatry. 
One of the theological arguments raised in support of the production and veneration of holy images was the 
doctrine of incarnation — Christ assuming a human na ­
ture — , as icons portrayed Christ in human form. 
The iconoclastic controversy resulted in significant chan ­
ges in art, since the production and use of icons was banned and many religious images in churches were de ­
stroyed and replaced either by the symbol of the cross or by simple decorative motifs. The failure of iconoclasm 
(lit. ‘image­smashing’) and the restoration of icons, 
which prevailed in the end, made icons an inseparable 
part of public and private worship. The oldest icon of the 
Byzantine and Christian Museum in Athens is an exam­
ple from this period, its first layer of painting dating 
from the ninth century AD."

duced during the reign of Constan -
tine the Great. Bronze with silver inlay, 4.5 x 4.5 cm, 1 63 gr, 6th cent. AD.
THE SHIFT TO LOCAL ECONOMIES
Another aspect that favoured the continuity of the Byz­
antine Empire was its ability to shift from a large­scale 
system to local and regional economic systems. The 
Mediterranean Sea had been the Romans’ mare nostrum 
(Latin, ‘our sea’) since Julius Caesar’s time. The Roman 
economy was Mediterranean­centred and depended on 
the sea for easy and relatively cheap transport. The eco­
nomic unity of the Mediterranean region is illustrated by 
the so­called African Red Slip Ware. This high­quality 
tableware was made in the province of Africa Proconsu­
laris (nowadays Tunisia with parts of Libya and Algeria). 
Its wide distribution across the Mediterranean shores 
and inland demonstrates lively east­west commercial ex ­
changes. The picture of commerce as a whole was rad ­
ically transformed after the Arabs’ occupation of the 
southern Mediterranean. The whole large­scale eco­
nomic network came to an end, with the single excep­
tion of Sicily (until 827, when the Arab invasion started). The economic shift that followed favoured the produc­tion of amphorae and tableware on a regional scale.
THE MILITARY
Another reason why the empire survived so long was the presence of a well­organised and efficient army.  
For an empire constantly under threat, the armies repre­
sented a necessary expense. Simple raids and major in ­
vading forces had to be faced, and not only on the bor ­
ders. In fact, Slav raids affected mainland Greece already 
in the sixth century. The hiding of the hoard of Krate­
gos­Mytilene on Lesbos (a Greek island in the Aegean 
Sea) has been linked to these invasions. The gold jewel­
lery, silverware, coins, and a bronze seal and signet ring 
were found by chance during the construction of Les­
bos’s airport. The dates of the coins and of the control 
stamps on the silverware indicate that the hoard was 
buried towards AD 630.

"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY42After the breakdown of the seventh century the Byzan­
tine army was organised according to the ‘theme system’, 
a network of territorial and military units (Greek the­

military and civil power. The army relied on the rela­
tively fertile areas of each theme for provisions. In the 
early eighth century the themes have distinct geographi­
cal boundaries, and fiscal autonomy by the end of the 
century. The advantages of this system were that the 
theme armies could meet major invading forces and push 
them back even after they had entered imperial territory

Kalliopi-Phaidra Kalafati
This is one of the earliest surviving 
double-sided icons that appeared after the restoration of the holy im -
ages in 843, at the end of the icon -
oclastic controversy that troubled the Byzantine Empire from 726. It is a so-called processional icon, meant to be carried in processions. Most notably, Christ is shown alive on the cross, with his eyes open. This iconographic element can be ascribed to the early Middle Byz -
antine period, perhaps as early as the 9th century, and survived until the 1 1th century, when it became normal to portray Christ already dead. On this side of the icon three layers of paint have been discov -
ered, from the 9th, 10th and 1 3th centuries. Icons were probably re -
painted when they had been dirt -
ied by candle smoke, damaged,  or to reflect a new theological  interpretation. The Virgin, St John, and the head of Christ were re -
painted the most recently. The  other side of the icon shows the Mother of God with the baby Jesus in her arms, in the type of Hode -
getria, ‘she who shows the way’.  Examination with X rays shows that this image, painted in the 1 6th century, probably conceals an  earlier Virgin, perhaps of the same date as the original Crucifixion on the obverse. The painter did not  follow the ‘austere’ frontal type of the triumphant Byzantine Hode -
getria. Instead, there is a gentle movement by the Virgin towards her child, indicated by a slight  inclination of her head. Tempera on panel, 87 x 63 cm, AD 800–1 600, Epirus (Greece).

PURPLE CODEX
This vellum (calfskin parchment) 
leaf belonged to the Codex Pur -
pureus Petropolitanus, a Greek Gospel Book dated to the sixth century. The text is written in silver and gold (for Christian sacred names) on purple-dyed pages, which indicates that it was made in the imperial scriptoria of Constan -
tinople. The purple manuscripts were luxury items associated with imperial circles. 
THE URBAN ELITES
Another factor of crucial importance for the continuity 
of the empire was the fact that in some cases, the fate of 
the empire converged with the interests of the elites. 
After the economic breakdown of the seventh century, 
urban recession is detected in most of the cities of the 
empire, one of the exceptions being Constantinople.  
Cities and their elites were economically reliant on 
larger ­scale economic exchange. The urban elites were 
no longer responsible for raising taxes — which was now 
done by imperial officials — sought a new role in the 
state hierarchy. The city ­level aristocracies, then, moved 
to the thematic military hierarchy in the province, to the 
ecclesiastical hierarchy, or to the state hierarchy. During 
the seventh century the Byzantine Empire was trans­formed and in the words of John Haldon ‘from a poly­
centric society became a metropolitanocentric empire 
focused in Constantinople’. 
For some historians this long transitional process from 
Late Antiquity to the early Middle Ages came to an end 
in 843, with the re­establishment of icon worship. The 
Eastern Roman Empire, now territorially restricted to  
its heartland, was gradually transformed into the Greek ­
speaking Christian realm of the Byzantine Empire."

In East Francia, the new empress be  -

decadence: Theophano allegedly in  -

her fingers, and went as far as taking a 
bath every day! It is questionable whe -
ther Theophano, who left Constantino -

certainly pre-dated her arrival.
In any case her new life cannot have 
been one of pomp and circumstance, 
since East Francia had no capital.  
As in Charlemagne’s time, the king  
or emperor ruled ‘from the saddle’,  
travelling from residence to residence (Pfalz) and from imperial abbey to 
bishopric by an itinerarium planned a 
year ahead. A Byzantine princess raised 
in the palace on the Bosporus, Theo -
phano must have had difficulty adapt -

residences were modest places — usu -
ally a fortified homestead with a stone hall and a living room that could be heated. Yet the charters that were 
drawn up along the way show that she 
accompanied Otto II on almost all of 
his itineraria. Her fourth child, the fu  -

from Aachen to Nijmegen.Theophano’s influence reached its  
peak after Otto II’s early death in 983. 
Their three-year-old son was crowned 
Emperor Otto III at Aachen, but it was 
undecided who was to be regent. As 
Theophano and Adelheid were in Italy 
at the time, Henry the Quarrelsome, a cousin of Otto II, claimed the regency. 
When it turned out he had an eye on 
the throne himself, the empire’s lead -
ing noblemen appointed Adelheid  and Theophano, who had meanwhile 
returned to Germany, as official re  -
gents. The compliment that Theo  phano 
ruled ‘like a man’ dates from this pe  -
riod. As her family ties to Constan  ti -
nople lost their use after the 97 6 mur -

misces, Theophano had to stand her ground vis-à-vis Constantinople speci -
fically in Italy, where the two empires’ 
in  terests competed the most. That is 
why she signed her charters there with 
the masculine name Theophanos 
Imperator.
Theophano died in Nijmegen and was 
buried in the Church of St Pantaleon  
in Cologne. Recent research suggests that Otto III had the St Nicholas Chapel 
(also known as Valkhof Chapel), near 
Nijmegen’s Carolingian Pfalz, built in 
memory of his mother Theophano.

EMPIRE AND THE RISE  
OF ISLAM,  
AD 300–800
Kianoosh Rezania
The Sassanid Empire was one of the most important civ ­
ilisations of Late Antiquity, lasting over four centuries.  
It extended from India and central Asia in the east to the 
Levant and the Mediterranean in the west, from the Ara­
bian Peninsula in the south to the Caspian region in the 
north. As the heirs of the Achaemenids, the Sassanids 
claimed an ancient, universal and sacred nature for their 
empire, and as such they were the Romans’ natural 
rivals. But the two superpowers also had diplomatic and 
economic exchanges. Because of its location, the Sassa­
nid Empire formed a cultural link between China and  
the Roman Empire with a great impact on the social and 
economic environment of the Silk Road. Through their 
long­lasting dominion and broad territory, the Sassanids 
established an empire whose cultural, political and econ­
omic influence went beyond their actual period and re ­
gion. Its demise in the seventh century AD left its suc­cessor, the Islamic Caliphate, a strong foundation for a 
vast and long­lived empire.
THE RISE OF THE EMPIRE
The Persian nobleman Ardashı ¯r defeated Ardawa ¯n IV, 
the last Parthian king, and founded the Sassanid Empire 
in AD 224. The Sassanids’ agenda mainly consisted in 
political and religious centralism, as opposed to the Par ­
thians’ local dynasties. Ardashı ¯r clearly presented this programme in the architecture of Ardashı ¯r ­Khwar  rah, 
the city he built in Persis: a circular city with three con­
centric zones around a centre in which a fire temple and a 
royal edifice lie close together, symbolising a centralised, hierarchic state where state power and religion cooper ­
ate closely. The reign of the second Sassanid king, Shapur I (r. 240–270), saw the emergence of a new religion: 
Ma nichaeism. Supported by the king, Manichaeism 
spread across Eurasia. Through intensive exchange with other religions, particularly Zoroastrianism and Christi­
anity, it deeply changed the religious field from China to 
Rome in the third century, with implications even for 
Islam.
ORGANISATION OF THE STATE
To be able to reign such an ample territory as a centralis­tic state, the Sassanids needed a sizeable administrative INVESTITURE

The Sassanid kings chose a beauti -
ful setting for their rock reliefs, ad -
jacent to sacred springs that empty 
into a large reflecting pool at the base of a mountain cliff. Their stra -
tegic location, in western Iran in the heart of the Zagros mountains, shows their importance; Ta ¯q-e

Road. The site has been turned into an archaeological park.apparatus. In the third century it already included gover ­
nors, viceroys, a steward of the royal property, a com­
mander of the royal guard, scribes, treasurers, judges and 
a market inspector, along with four groups of aristocrats. 
The reign of Yazdegird I (AD 399–420) saw an expansion 
of the administrative organisation. The introduction of a 
military governor — marzba ¯n, literally ‘protector of the 
border’ — was an innovation: border provinces were no 
longer ruled by princes acting like kings, but by gover ­
nors. The empire was moreover divided into four, each 
quarter (kust) being controlled by a general (spa ¯hbed)  
as to the military aspect and by an ‘authority’ (rad ) as to 
religion. Spatially and administratively, the empire (iran­shahr) was further divided into provinces (shahr), and 
the provinces into districts (a w e s t a¯ m ). Although under 
Khosrow II (r. 590–628) the structure was changed into one of thirty ­five administrative units, state organisation 
remained centralised. State power was distributed over several departments (d ı¯w a ¯ n ): the chancellery, the regis­tration office for sealing documents, the treasury for 
imposing taxes, the administration office for royal mat­
ters, judicial departments, and offices for religious mat­
ters. This extensive apparatus provided stability even at 
critical moments, such as the king’s death and succession.
According to Middle­Persian sources, Sassanid society 
was restructured in the fifth century, apparently follow ­
ing Avestan social theory. The Avesta  — the primary text 
collection of Zoroastrianism, the main Sassanid religion "
"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY50at the time — distinguishes three social strata: priests, 
warriors, and peasants. In Sassanid society a fourth 
group was in fact added, namely the craftsmen. 
There were innovations in the religious administration 
as well in the fifth century. Parallel to the title ‘King of 
Kings’ (sha ¯ha ¯n sha ¯h), the office of ‘Priest of Priests’ was 
introduced, and so was the religious office of ‘Protector 
of the Poor and Judge’, which meant that this official  
was to protect the interests of the destitute. 
DIVINE OR KAYANID DESCENT?
Another Sassanid innovation regards the ideology of 
legitimisation. While the early Sassanids claimed to be  
of divine descent, later dynasty members linked them­
selves to the Kayanids, a mythical dynasty known from 
the Avesta . The new strategy appears at the end of the 
fourth century, running parallel to the older one for some decades: Shapur III (r. 383–388) was the first king 
who on his coins designated himself kay , the Kayanids’ 
royal title, and traced his descent back to them. Yazde­gird II (r. 439–457), on the other hand, was the last Sassa­
nid king to claim divine descent on his coins. By the end 
of the fifth century, Kawa ¯d I (r. 488–96, 499–531) used the kay title on coins and elsewhere. The claim of Kaya­
nid descent also points to a closer connection between Zoroastrianism and the Sassanid state. 
STATE AND RELIGION
Islamic sources on the Sassanid Empire use the word ‘siblings’ to define the connection between state and re ­
ligion. Religion is presented as the foundation of king­ship and kingship as the defender of the faith. In re ­
search, this religious­political concept has sometimes been interpreted as a Late Sassanid or even Early Islamic 
development which the sources then projected back 
onto the Early Sassanid period, but we have already seen 
that the architecture of Ardashı ¯r ­Khwarrah, the city CIRCULAR CITY

"51 THE SASSANID EMPIRE AND THE RISE OF ISLAM, AD 300–800built by the first Sassanid king, unequivocally pro­
claimed this concept. 
RELIGIOUS MINORITIES
Although the Sassanids were well aware of the impor ­
tance of religious minorities for their empire, the way 
they dealt with non­Zoroastrians reveals neither sys­
tematic tolerance nor general intolerance. Both massive 
repression of religious minorities and a liberal stance 
towards them should be interpreted as products of par ­
ticular events and especially as reactions to actions from those minorities. After Yazdegird I’s marriage to the 
daughter of the leader of the Babylon Jewish commu­
nity, he was more inclined to support the Jews and had a 
group of them settle in Isfahan (Iran). During his reign 
Christians enjoyed more freedom as well: after the 409 
peace treaty with the Byzantines, Christians were even 
allowed to bury their dead, which ran contrary to Zoro­
astrian concepts of purity. In 410 the first synod in Sassa­
nid territory was held in Seleucia (now Al­Mada’in, 
Iraq); subsequently a Christian office was even intro­
duced into the Sassanid administration. The Zoroastrian 
priests, however, put an end to the Christians’ freedom. These events had consequences for Yazdegird’s succes­sion: the upper classes blocked his sons from their in ­
heritance and it was only after several attempts that  Bahra ¯m V (r. 420–38), one of his younger sons, could 
succeed. In the first years of his reign, he had to fight the Hephthalites on the east border and the Byzantines in 
the west. In 422 the peace with Constantinople was re­
established; two years later the Sassanid Christian com­
munity declared its independence from the Roman 
Church. 
AN EGALITARIAN MOVEMENT
The peace with the Roman Empire, however, was unsta­ble. As drought, famine, civil war and succession con­
flicts came on top of the wars with Constantinople and 
the Hephthalites, Pe ¯ro ¯z (r. 459–484) had to impose a 
general tax that made things even more difficult for his subjects. This situation gave the Zoroastrian school of 
Zara ¯dusht­Mazdak an opportunity to promote its egali­
tarian views concerning the distribution of wealth as 
well as women — an agenda directed against the men at 
court who enjoyed immense riches as well as great har ­
ems. The Zara ¯dusht­Mazdak doctrine led to a movement SASSANID SILVER

that included looting and anarchy, marking the last dec­

During his first reign, Kawa ¯d I took an interest in the 
Zara ¯dusht­Mazdak doctrine, using it to curb the power 
of the nobles. They dethroned him nonetheless and dur ­
ing his second reign he had no other option but oppos­ing the Mazdakites. His future successor Khosrow I  
(r. 531–579) drowned the movement in blood in 529. The 
events make it clear that the court nobles’ support was 
needed for a prince to be able to succeed to the throne: 
Kawa ¯d I’s successor was not his eldest son, who har ­
boured Mazdakite sympathies, but the younger brother who had won the aristocracy’s trust with the massacre. 
SOCIAL INNOVATIONS
The Sassanid kings took various measures to keep the 
nobility’s political and economic power in check. In the 
Early Sassanid period, the nobles’ social rank was deter ­
mined solely by their descent. From the mid­fifth cen­tury however their rank was determined by the king, 
whose decision took precedence over a nobleman’s 
actual descent. This royal power enabled Khosrow I to 
favour the lesser country nobles (dehqa¯ n in New ­Per ­
sian), who mostly served as tax collectors. The dehqa¯ n 
class lived on in Early Islamic society and contributed to 
handing down ancient cultural heritage in Islamic Iran. 
Kawa ¯d I attempted to improve the economic situation 
and quell social unrest with a series of measures, restruc­
turing the empire’s administrative organisation and im ­
plementing a cadastral survey of arable lands. Khosrow I continued the project, earning a reputation as a just king. 
Then the applicable land tax was determined, de  pending 
on the type of produce: wheat, barley, rice, lucerne, 
grapes, dates, or olives. All other crops were tax­exempt. 
As a reaction to the Mazdakite movement as well as 
Christian ideals, Khosrow I introduced the office of ‘Pro­
tector of the Poor and Judge’, which Muslim rulers later 
decided to keep.
THE SASSANID EMPIRE AS A CULTURAL HUB
After repeated conflicts with the East­Roman Empire, Khosrow in 561 concluded a fifty ­year peace treaty with 
the Byzantines, which incidentally did not last ten years. The treaty included freedom of religion for Christians in 
the Sassanid Empire and for Zoroastrians in the Byzan­
tine Empire. As Khosrow loved philosophy, he invited 
Neo­Platonic philosophers to his realm and offered 
them a home after the Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565) had 
closed their school in Athens. During Khosrow’s reign 
philosophical, scientific and literary texts were trans­
lated from Sanskrit, Greek and Syriac into Middle­Per ­
sian. Culture imported from India included Kalilag ud damnag — a Middle­Persian collection of animal fables 
from India which survives only in the sixth­century Syr  ­
iac and eighth­century Arabic translations — and the 
game of chess, which seems to have inspired the Persians 
in their turn to invent backgammon. Both games and the 
Indian animal fables, known as Panchatantra, via the 
Sassanid Empire found their way to Europe in the Is ­
lamic period. Western works, such as the Romance of Alexander, were also translated into Middle­Persian un ­
der the Sassanids, and this text translated into Syriac in 
its turn. In the early Islamic period the Syriac version 
was translated into Arabic, whereas the Middle­Persian 
translation was lost in this case as well. "

As opposed to his father, Khosrow’s son Hurmizd IV  
(r. 579–90) favoured the citizens against the court nobles 
and the Zoroastrian religious teachers (he ¯rbed) against 
the religious officials (mowbed). He was succeeded by 
the last Sassanid king of great imperial power, Khosrow 
II (r. 591–628), who styled himself ‘the Triumphant’ and 
had the motto ‘May he make Iran prosper’ printed on his 
coins. He gave the performance aspect of Zoroastrianism 
a boost by having over 300 fire temples constructed and 
having over 10,000 priests conduct rituals there. 
After a break in Sassanid relief art that lasted c.200 years, 
Khosrow II had himself depicted on his investiture relief 
in the biggest iwan (a rectangular hall open on one side) 
of Ta ¯q­e Bosta ¯n in what is now Kermanshah (Iran) 
flanked by Ahura Mazda ¯ and Ana ¯hita ¯, the supreme 
Zo ro astrian god and an important Zoroastrian goddess. 
While Khosrow is represented as bigger than either deity and standing on a higher pedestal, Ahura Mazda ¯ gives 
him the royal ring and tiara. 
The seventh century began with the last war between the 
Sassanid and Byzantine superpowers. The Sassanids con­
quered Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Armenia and finally, in May 614, Jerusalem. Khosrow the Triumphant killed 
countless Christians, burned down their churches, took 
many prisoners including the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and 
founded a fire temple in Jerusalem. He took the Holy 
Cross to Persia and gave it to the fire temple of A ¯dur 
Gushnasp in A ¯durba ¯daga ¯n, whose ruins can still be ad ­
mired at Takht­e Soleyma ¯n near Sanjan (Iran). After three 
years the situation for Jerusalem’s Christians gradually 
improved, while the Sassanids continued their march 
west: in 619 they invaded Egypt, Ethiopia and Libya. 
After 620 the tide of war turned and the Byzantines were 
able to retake Armenia, even reaching A ¯durba ¯daga ¯n so 
that they could take back the Holy Cross. The Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–541) destroyed the royal palace on the 
east bank of the Tigris. Khosrow II had lost all faith in his 
officers and had many of them executed or imprisoned; 
in 628 he was taken prisoner by officers in his turn. They 
enthroned his son Kawa ¯d II and made him kill his father. 
Kawa ¯d II (r. 628) during his brief reign killed all his broth­
ers and was succeeded by his seven­year ­old son. A crisis 
ensued and as there were no men left in the royal family, 
the women took over political leadership: Bu ¯ra ¯n (r. 630–
1), Khosrow II’s daughter and Kawa ¯d II’s wife, and her  
sister A ¯zarmı ¯gdukht, who passed the empire on to the 
last king, Yazdegird III (r. 631–51).THE SASSANIDS AND ARABIA
Islamic historiography attests to a Sassanid presence on 
the Arabian Peninsula: during the reign of Khosrow I 
they reached what is now Yemen by sea, and certainly 
from the mid­sixth century there was a Zoroastrian 
community there. With their influence in southern  
Arabia, especially the Gulf of Aden, the Sassanids aimed 
to limit Byzantine trade over the Red Sea. Khosrow II "

Although superpowers often

north and east Arabia, including what is now Bahrain, 
Oman, the Najd and Hejaz regions, and even part of the 
Medina region. In the time of Muhammad, Sassanid 
influence began to wane. The second ‘rightly guided 
caliph’ (al­khulafa ar ­rashidun), Umar (r. 634–644), led 
successful campaigns against the Sassanids, conquering Mesopotamia (Iraq) with the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon 
in 636, Khuzestan (south­west Iran) and Media (north­
west Iran) in 642, and finally Azerbaijan (north­east 
Iran). 
Umar’s expeditions made him highly unpopular with 
the Persians, and in 644 he was assassinated by one. His 
successor, Uthman (r. 644–656), made further conquests 
including Khorazan (mainly in modern Afghanistan and 
Iran), where Yazdegird III made his last stand before he 
was murdered by a miller in 651. Widespread resistance against the conquerors only resulted in repression and 
more conquests, further expanding the Islamic Cali­
phate. During the reign of the fourth caliph, Ali ibn Abi­
Talib (r. 656–662), the caliphate’s capital was moved 
from Medina to Kufa (Iran). This power transfer as well 
as Ali’s tendency not to deal with his subjects according 
to ethnicity earned him a reputation of justice among 
the Persians, enabling him to win their hearts while his 
predecessors had conquered with the sword.
RISE OF THE ABBASIDS
While the Umayyad caliphs (662–750) adopted the  
Sassanid administration system, coin minting, the office 
of vizier (minister) and the d ı¯w a¯ n  (the aforementioned 
departments for various purposes), they set the Arabs over the other ethnic groups. This ethnic inequality, 
combined with economic circumstances, led to new "

A cataphract was a type of heavily 
armoured cavalry deployed by a number of peoples of the Eurasian steppe and the Near East, includ -
ing the Sassanids. The word, deriv -
ing from Greek kataphrassein, ‘to protect’, may also refer to a single armoured cavalryman. The Roman army adopted cataphract-like cav -
alry during the late 3rd and the 4th century. The cataphract is thought to have influenced the later European knights, possibly via the Byzantine Empire. Re-enactment of a Sassanid cataphract.rebellions and massacres across Iran, Iraq and Khorazan. 
By the end of the Umayyad reign, even the Arabs in Iraq 
were discontented. They sent an envoy — who was as ­
sisted by Zoroastrian and Buddhist dehqa¯ n — to Kho­
razan to win the support of the Arabs who had settled 
there. That was the beginning of the Abbasid revolution, 
which from 747 spread from Khorazan to Nahavand and 
Ray (Iran), the Euphrates region, and finally Damas­
cus — the caliphate’s capital — in 750, when the fate of 
the Umayyad dynasty was sealed. The Abbasids moved the capital to Iraq once more, thereby enhancing the 
importance of Persian culture in the development of 
Islamic civilisation. The elements of the Sassanid state 
organisation that the Umayyads had tentatively adopted 
were developed further by the Ab  basids, while the posi­
tion of Persians and their language was much improved.It should be noted that conquest of a territory by Mus­
lims did not necessarily entail the inhabitants’ conver ­
sion to Islam, nor was the Iranians’ conversion always forced upon them: their knowledge of Islam goes back to 
the time of Muhammad (570–632), who credited the 
Zoroastrians of Yemen with the status of ‘people of the Book’. Like Jews and Christians, Zoroastrians could keep 
their religion by paying a higher general tax. The caliphs 
thus had no particular interest in converting them, and 
the conversion process was drawn out over several cen­
turies. The financial interest of the dehqa¯ n was a decisive 
factor here, as they preferred paying the higher tax while remaining in office as tax collectors. 
THE SASSANID HERITAGE
During its 400­year existence, Sassanid culture com­bined Iranian and Mesopotamian elements and as Islam 
rose, it presented itself as the cultural heir of ancient  
Persia and Mesopotamia — a tradition of dominion that 
the caliphs could hardly neglect. Therefore the ascent of Islam on the Arabian Peninsula, its triumphant arrival  
in Sassanid Iran and the establishment of an Islamic em ­
pire should be interpreted not only as a break in western Asia’s cultural and political tradition, but also as a con­
tinuation. During the long process of Islamic conquest 
the Persian world was Islamised, but at the same time 
the Sassanid cultural heritage Persianised Islamic civili­
sation as it started to flourish. "

IN THE EARLY  
MIDDLE AGES
Vicente Salvatierra and  
Irene Montilla Torres
The period between the fifth and the eleventh century 
bears witness to the emergence in Europe of many fea­
tures that will characterise the following centuries. The 
two major characteristics of that period are ethnic mo ­
bility and the ‘transfer’ of beliefs, knowledge and cul  tural 
elements between East and West, North and South. The 
complex fusion resulting from the above laid the foun­
dations of human, economic and intellectual wealth 
across Europe in the centuries to follow.
The Iberian Peninsula’s role in the process started when 
it was part of the Roman Empire and developed further 
under the influence of Christianity and the new cultural 
codes it imposed. These factors underlie the interaction 
of subsequent events, among which we can highlight the 
Islamic conquest in 711. From then on, ancient Hispania 
became known as al­ Andalus and a historical process be ­
gan that would differ from the events in the rest of me ­
dieval Europe.
LATE ANTIQUITY: THE HISPANO-ROMAN,  
GERMANIC, AND BYZANTINE PEOPLES
Some of the tribes that invaded the Roman Empire set­tled in the Iberian Peninsula from the fifth century AD 
onwards. Of these, the Suebi and the Visigoths even 
built independent states in the peninsula and contrib­
uted significantly to its culture. Their cultural stock 
mixed with eastern influences as a result of the Byzan­
tine occupation of the southern and eastern coasts of the 
Iberian peninsula from the year 555 onwards during Jus­
tinian’s renovatio imperii.VISIGOTHIC COLUMN

"57 AL-ANDALUS IN THE EARLY MIDDLE AGESBeyond the political and military events of the time, the 
traditional position holds that the Byzantine occupation 
was made possible by the religious conflict between the 
Arian Visigoths and the Catholic Hispano­Romans. The 
conflict ended with the conversion to Catholicism of 
Reccared I (r. 586–601) and the Gothic aristocracy at the 
Third Council of Toledo (589). This view rests upon an 
approach based on religion: the Catholics supported the 
Byzantines against the Arian monarchy. Consequently, 
first the Arian king Liuvigild (r. 568–586) and then his 
converted successor, Reccared, would have tried to use 
religious unification to strengthen the monarchy against 
inner divisive forces and against the external danger of 
the Byzantines in the south and the Franks in the north. 
The use of religion to forge one common identity may 
also explain the brutal persecution of Judaism by Recca­
red’s successors and their attempts to achieve the Jews’ 
conversion. It is worth remarking that the conflicts in 
the Middle Ages were of a religious, not a racial nature: it 
was religious practice that was persecuted. Racial perse­cution in Europe started as late as the sixteenth century.Other authors, for example Ch. Wickham, support a dif­
ferent hypothesis and argue that the Byzantines settled 
in the peninsula thanks to the support of the southern 
and eastern aristocracy as well as traders. The latter seem 
to have started their activities in the Mediterranean area 
c. AD 500, and their goods flowed into towns at least 
until the early seventh century. This may also explain 
why the Byzantine influence on the arts carried with it 
the influence of other peoples too, namely peoples who 
were in the same network, such as the Longobards.
The seventh century was marked by a complex crisis. 
Poor harvests, pests and plagues decimated the popula­
tion and seriously damaged trade in the Mediterranean. 
In this context, the Visigoth kings managed to expel the 
Byzantines from the peninsula in 624. At the other end 
of the Mediterranean, the Arab Empire was expanding. 
This is one of the factors that helped trade recover, even 
if on entirely different foundations.BRONZE LAMP

is candil , which derives from the  
Arabic qandil or q u ı¯ n d i l , which in

rated; this is the deluxe version for the well-to-do. It was customary to add salt to the oil to make the flame brighter. Bronze, h. 10. 1 cm, 9th–10th cent., Jimena (Jaén, Spain).  "
"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY58HISPANO-VISIGOTHS, ARABS AND BERBERS:  
THE EMIRATE OF AL-ANDALUS
The factor that sets the Iberian peninsula apart from the 
rest of Europe is the Islamic conquest in the early eighth 
century. The inflow of new and diverse peoples (Arabs, 
Syrians, Egyptians, Maghrebis, and so on) and social 
structures of tribe and state along new cultural and artis­
tic influences meant: 1) the reintroduction of Graeco­
Roman components (technological, philosophical) that 
had been lost in the West but not in the East; and 2) the 
influx of the new traditions, techniques and artistic ten­
dencies developed by the Umayyads in Syria over the 
seventh century. As remarked by E. Manzano, various 
cultural and commercial stages can be identified in the 
following centuries.In the eighth century, or at least until the late seventh 
century, commercial exchange was rare due to the virtu­
ally permanent confrontation between the two groups 
of invaders: Arabs and Berbers. When the Umayyad 
prince Abd al­Rahman ibn Muawiya seized power in 
754, he separated the Iberian peninsula from the Arab 
Empire governed by the Abbasid caliphs, who had taken 
over from the Umayyads in Baghdad in 750. He later had 
to struggle continuously to retain his hegemony. This 
disrupted the inflow of gold from central Africa and, in 
turn, not only led to a shortage of gold across western 
Europe but also forced al­ Andalus and the Frankish 
realm to coin silver. In the last quarter of the eighth and early ninth century, 
Charlemagne started his advance into al­ Andalus with 
an attack on Zaragoza (778) and the conquest of Gerona (785) and Barcelona (801). According to J. Signes, some of 
these military actions must have been triggered by grow ­
ing pressure by pirates from al­ Andalus. Piracy appears 
alongside the coastal trade that developed to move ma­ teri  als produced in large quantities. The additional evi­
dence of small treasures retrieved in the peninsula con­taining dirhams, Carolingian coins and the occasional 
Idrisid (i.e. Moroccan) coin suggests that trade contacts spread from the Maghreb to the Carolingian Empire. 
The arrangement of several centres of power (the 
Umayy    ad Emirate of Cordoba, Carolingian Aachen, 
papal Rome, and so on), all capable of creating a sus­
tained and large­scale demand for luxury goods, must 
have brought new life to commercial relations. Slaves 
must have been the only ‘merchandise’ to have been in 
high demand continuously. It is worth mentioning that 
one of the terms used for the slaves from al­ Andalus  
was ‘Slav’ (from which our word ‘slave’ in fact derives), possibly because many were sold by Carolingian rulers 
after their raids in the east. 
In the middle of the ninth century, major political chan ­
ges took place across Europe. The first stage of the Caro­lingian Empire’s division (841) coincides with a large­scale transformation of the Umayyad state in al­ Andalus. 
The emirs Abd al­Rahman II (r. 822–852) and Muham­mad I (r. 852–886) fostered urban development and irri­
gated farmland to supply towns. The transformation 
al    so became noticeable in the development of material 
culture as local handmade pottery was replaced by wheel­thrown pottery produced in large quantities. 
Large production relies on the availability of distribution 
networks and markets capable of absorbing it.COINS

coin (dated 885 and 777), both silver, from the archaeological site of Marroquíes Bajos (Jaén, Spain). They were part of a hoard that was concealed during a period of insta -

tions were not limited to the elites, as in that case the coins would have been melted down and reminted as dirhams. On the contrary, they must have reached the people di -
rectly and circulated among them."

doba, the Madinat al-Zahra, and the Aljama Mosque in Almería. These capitals all appear to have been made in a single production area concentrated in Cordoba,  ruling out the possibility that there were local workshops across al-Andalus.

shops, barracks, residences and baths. Water was supplied through a Roman aqueduct reformed for  this purpose."
"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY60The links with the Abbasid Empire became stabler and 
closer. The sources attest the presence in al­ Andalus of 
key figures for the internalisation of Abbasid cultural components, for example the musician Ziryab, who 
arrived in al­ Andalus during the reign of Abd al­Rah­
man II. Scientific expeditions to Cairo, Baghdad and other eastern cities that are shrines of Islamic culture 
became widespread, as did the tradition of pilgrimage 
(the latter related to the religious duty to visit Mecca). 
The biographies that have come down to us prove that 
virtually no public figure of the time, whether in reli­
gion, literature or science, rose to hold a major position 
without having travelled to the East first. This is closely 
related to the increasing influence of religion, supported 
by the emirs. The emirs legitimised their policies from 
religion. The Maliki school of Islam prevailed in al­ An­dalus, and its view of Islam and its religious practice  had a strong influence on the country’s identity.
Contacts between Byzantine emperors and Umayyad 
emirs are attested in the records too. For example, the 
Emperor Theophilus sent ambassadors to Abd al­Rah­
man II in 839–840 to establish an alliance against the 
Abbasids. In return, the emir sent al­Ghazal, a poet, an 
alchemist and an astronomer, which suggests a more cul­
tural approach on their side. Al­Ghazal was also an am ­
bassador to the court of the Danish king Horic in 845–846, shortly after the first Viking attack on al­ Andalus.
The last decades of the ninth century and the first of the tenth were marked in al­ Andalus by the crisis of the 
emirate, and in Europe by the division of the central power into the successor kingdoms to the Carolingian 
Empire and by increasingly numerous Viking raids."

M. Acién proved that the crisis in al­ Andalus was due 
first to a rebellion of Muladi farm owners (the Muladis 
being Christians converted to Islam), badly hit by the 
urban growth that took away their control over peasants. 
Shortly afterwards there followed the rebellion of some 
of the main Arab and Berber lineages who contested the 
Umayyad control, and of cities such as Mérida, Toledo 
and Zaragoza, fighting to release themselves from Cor ­
doba’s centralism. These developments must have caused the collapse of at 
least some part of the commercial network between the 
political centres in Europe. The trade in the Mediterra­
nean was quick to recover, though: this is the time when 
towns with protected harbours appeared in al­ Andalus, 
for instance Pechina (Almería). Muslim colonies were founded, for example in Freixenetum (Provence) and on the mouth of the river Garigliano (Lazio, Italy). These 
were the bases of their trade and of their raids in the western Mediterranean. Slave trade was still one of the 
main types of trade among the Umayyads. Some slaves 
were raised in court and even reached key administrative 
positions. As slave trade was abundant and sustained 
over time, it must have eventually resulted in a major 
source of new population. 
According to S. Gutiérrez, the large containers for stor ­
age of wine, oil, dairy and so on, standard and luxury crockery and metal objects retrieved from shipwrecks  
off the Provence coast attest to a commercial network in 
the Mediterranean (al­ Andalus, Liguria, Sicily, northern 
Africa) from the ninth to the early tenth century. Appar ­
ently it was mainly coastal trade, and the goods seldom 
reached far inland."

The long political crisis described above was followed  
by the Umayyad heyday, at the time when Abd al­Rah­
man III established the caliphate (929). From that point 
onwards, al­ Andalus is a geographical and a social fact, 
that is, very dissimilar elements had merged to form a new identity: the identity of al­ Andalus. This period 
stands out for several reasons as regards trade and cul­ture.
The Umayyads opened new trade routes with central 
Africa in conflict with Shia kingdoms by then independ­
ent from the Abbasid Empire, such as the Idrisids in  
Fez and especially the Fatimids in what is now Tunisia. 
The new routes re­established the inflow of gold and 
other precious goods such as ivory, which were in high 
and regular demand in Cordoba and other cities. A new 
ex  change network thus grew around these major cities. 
This had an unquestionable effect on the region. Regar    d­
ing material culture, a range of elements ap  peared, such 
as ivory boxes and vessels or silk fabrics produced by the 
artisans of the caliphate. Pottery was the most abundant 
good. The so­called green and manganese pottery stands 
out, often interpreted as caliphal production since it combines the green of Islam and the white of the Umay­yads. Most of these goods remain in the churches or the nunneries of the Christian kingdoms in the peninsula. According to the tradition, they were war spoils, but it 
has recently been suggested that many may have been 
diplomatic gifts. Others, as has been convincingly been 
proposed by M. Roser Owen, may have been traded or 
used as reliquaries for relics brought from al­ Andalus.
The contact with Christian rulers in Europe increased, with highly remarkable ambassador missions, e.g. the 
ambassador exchange with Otto I. The exchange be ­
tween Cordoba and Constantinople was more impor ­
tant, with at least thirteen ambassadors sent between 
942 and 970. Some of the gifts for Abd al­Rahman III "

of the mirhab (niche indicating the direction of Mecca) of 
the mosque of Cordoba’s front wall in the time of al­Ha­
kam II (r. 961–976). Another important gift is a copy of 
Dioscorides’ treatise on herbal medicine. It was trans­
lated into Arabic by the Spanish­born Jewish physician 
Hasday ibn Shaprut. According to the specialists, this 
marks the beginning of the study of Greek botany in al­
Andalus. It later spread to the Latin­Christian kingdoms 
that started the renewal of scientific knowledge in the 
West. Ibn Shaprut was the head of the customs service 
under Abd al­Rahman III, a high position in the cali­
phate’s administration. He was a landmark in medieval 
Judaism and allegedly developed contacts with the Kha ­
zarian Empire by the Black Sea, the only Jewish state of the Middle Ages. 
A large number of writings imported from the Arab 
Empire into al­ Andalus spawned major reference works, 
such as the treaties on farming and hydroponics that 
made possible the introduction and acclimatisation of a 
number of eastern species that renewed medieval farm 
produce. Another major work is the so­called Picatrix 
(Ghayat al­Hakim) by Maslama al­Qurtubi (d. 964), a 
renowned astronomer, geometrist and astrologist. His 
works were about magic and occult sciences, which were 
closely interrelated and were the foundations of the sci­
entific knowledge of the time. The Picatrix became well­
known across Europe after the Latin translation sup­
ported by King Alfonso X (thirteenth century). 
The Caliphate of Cordoba disappeared in the eleventh 
century. This unleashed a long political crisis on both 
sides of the Mediterranean, but did not stop economic 
and cultural development. Its influence reached the 
Christian kingdoms when they seized the cities south  
of the river Duero (Toledo 1084). The knowledge trans­
fer from al­ Andalus was continuous. In the thirteenth 
century, King Alfonso X was personally involved in this transfer by founding the School of Translators of Toledo. 
The School translated into Latin every scientific work 
within its reach, thus disseminating knowledge from  al­Andalus across Christian Europe through the follow ­
ing century."

CROSSROADS DIVERSITY 64Ibn Shaprut was born in a Jewish family 
in Jaén (in al-Andalus, Islamic Spain) 
on an uncertain date around 910 and 
died in Cordoba in 970. From an early 
age, he studied various languages: He  -
brew (his religious language), Arabic (the official language of al-Andalus), 
Latin and the incipient Romance Castil -
ian, among others. He also made in-
depth studies of the Talmudic teachings 
and Arab style and literature. He had 
extensive knowledge of the sciences, 
especially in the medico-pharmaceuti -
cal field. Ibn Shaprut managed to be  -
come part of the Cordoban court and 
was appointed by Abd al-Rahman III  
(r. 91 2–96 1) as director of the customs service, one of the most important 
posts in the administration. After Abd al-Rahman’s death Ibn Shaprut contin -
ued to enjoy the confidence of his suc -"
"cessor, al-Hakam II (r. 96 1–97 6). 
He played an important and decisive 
role in the successive embassies sent 
between the Byzantine Empire and al-
Andalus. Although it has always been 
assumed that the ambassadors were 
sent by the caliph or the emperor, there 
is evidence that in both states there were other people interested in estab -
lishing such diplomatic relations. One of them was Ibn Shaprut, who not only 
acted as the caliph’s representative, but 
also instigated many of the contacts 
himself. The bishop of Cordoba, as  
representative of the Mozarab commu -
nity (Christians living in al-Andalus), also played an important role in organ -
ising and carrying out these embassies.
In 950, Byzantine emissaries arrived in Cordoba (the capital of al-Andalus).  
As a gift for the caliph they brought  the treatise De materia medica written 
by Dioscorides in the first century AD. 
This highly-prized manuscript was a 
compilation of the medical and phar -
macological knowledge of classical Greece, describing the therapeutic use 
of some six hundred plants and many 
medicinal oils and stones. It was written 
in Greek, however, and there was no  -
body in al-Andalus who could translate 
such a complex text into Arabic. Faced 
with this situation, Abd al-Rahman III 
asked the Byzantine emperor to send a 
translator with knowledge of Greek and 
Latin. The request was met and in 95 1/ 
952 the monk Nicholas arrived in Cor -
doba. He worked intensively with Ibn 
Shaprut for a decade to complete the 
Arabic translation. The importance of this cannot be overstated, as it repre -
sented the beginning of the study of Greek botany in al-Andalus, from 
where it would subsequently spread to 
Christian Europe.It must have been through those con -
tacts with the Byzantine Empire that Ibn Shaprut learned of the existence of the 
Khazar kingdom, which occupied part 
of the Russian steppe and had estab -
lished Judaism as state religion. After much trouble he was able to contact its 
ruler, Khan Joseph, with whom he ex  -
changed correspondence. He also di  -
rectly arranged the embassy sent by the 
Emperor Otto I in 954, headed by Abbot Johannes von Gorze. The abbot 
said he had ‘never seen a man of such 
subtle intellect’ as Ibn Shaprut.
His fame as a doctor travelled beyond 
the frontiers of al-Andalus and he was 
summoned by Queen Toda of Navarra 
to treat her grandson Sancho I the Fat, king of León, who had been deposed 
due to his extreme obesity. The queen’s 
objectives were, on the one hand, to 
find a cure for her grandson and, on the 
other, to make a powerful military ally. 
Abd al-Rahman III sent Ibn Shaprut to 
Pamplona, where he convinced Toda 
and Sancho to travel to Cordoba to 
establish a political and military agree -
ment and begin the healing process. 
The latter was achieved thanks to Ibn 
Shaprut’s prescription of a new diet, a 
treatment consisting of medicinal herbs 
and physical exercise. Apparently the 
physician managed to convince them  
to make part of the journey from Pam -
plona to Cordoba on foot.
In Cordoba, Ibn Shaprut founded a  
Talmudic school with teachers from the 
East. He repeatedly defended the inter -
ests of Jewish communities, both in al-Andalus and elsewhere. We know of the 
epistolary contacts he maintained with Jews in southern Italy, a territory under 
Byzantine rule. Likewise, he interceded 
to improve the situation of the Jews of 
Constantinople and southern France. Hasday ibn Shaprut was an outstanding physician and pharmacologist, an ex  -
pert polyglot, a skilled diplomat and politician, a generous patron of schol -
ars and writers, and the founder of the 
school of Hebrew philology in Cor -
doba. This fruitful activity made him one of the outstanding figures in the 
history of al-Andalus and Judaism.

In contrast to common belief,  this process was not limited to religion, but affected the social and economic spheres most. The development of town planning, commerce, and the manufacture of items for daily use clearly attest to this. Religion was not a decisive factor in the make-up of this society, as al-Andalus, particularly dur -

EGYPT
Tineke Rooijakkers
Egypt was — and still is — a country defined by its geog­
raphy. Known for its bountiful harvests, its very exist­
ence was determined by the great river of the Nile, and 
life was structured around its cycle of inundation. Farm­
ing was restricted to the Nile Valley, the Delta, and the 
Fa  yum Basin, which was watered by a channel. There 
was little occupation in the inhospitable mountainous 
deserts to the east and west, except in the oases. This 
unique environment is also the reason why we know so 
much about Egyptian civilisation today. The hot and dry 
desert sands ensured the preservation of organic materi­
als such as wood, textiles and, perhaps most importantly, 
papyrus. From short notes on pot shards (ostraka) to 
Bible manuscripts, the large numbers of extant texts  
provide a window on Late Antique Egyptian society.
In the fourth century AD, Egypt was a province of the 
Roman Empire and very much a part of the greater Hel­
lenised East. Its culture was characterised by a mixture  
of mainly Greek and Egyptian elements, within which  
a distinct form of Christianity would develop. Egypt’s 
capital Alexandria was the hub of the eastern Mediterra­
nean, surpassed only by Constantinople. It was home to large numbers of Greek settlers as well as many immi­
grants from the eastern Mediterranean, including a  
substantial Jewish community. This vibrant cosmopoli­tan city was also an internationally renowned centre  
of culture and learning. In the early Christian era, the 
famous Catechetical School of Alexandria fostered in ­
fluential theologians such as Pantaenus (d. c.200), Clem­ent of Alexandria (c.150–c.215), and Origen (184/5–
253/4), who infused Christian theology with Greek 
philosophical reasoning. 
The main languages used in Egypt were Greek and Egyp­
tian, and to a lesser extent Latin by the Roman adminis­
tration. Coptic was developed in the third century as  
a new way to write Egyptian after the Demotic script  
(a cursive and abbreviated form of Egyptian writing)  
had largely fallen out of use in the first century. Based  
on the Greek alphabet and rich in Greek vocabulary, it 
was mainly used in Christian contexts at first and only 
be  came more generally employed from the sixth century 
onward. The term ‘Coptic’ is also used to describe the period or material culture from the first Christians until 
the Arab conquest, although this is anachronistic. The 
term is based on the Arabic qibt, which again is a bas­
tardisation of the Greek 'Aigyptos', and was used by the Arabs to describe the inhabitants of Egypt. Because most 
native Egyptians were Christian, it later became associ­
ated with Egyptian Christians specifically.
EGYPT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN TRADE NETWORK
Like Rome before it, Constantinople was dependent on Egyptian wheat, shipped across the choppy Mediterra­
nean Sea, to feed its hungry urban multitudes. This was, 
however, far from the only export product. The Edict  
of Maximum Prices, issued by the Emperor Diocletian  
(r. 284–305) in 301, mentions for example Alexandrine 
glass (which generally fetched a higher price than any 
other type), writing reeds, linen, opium from Thebes, 
and different types of stone such as porphyry, red gran­
ite from Syene (Aswan), and grey granite from Mons 
Claudianus. Other coveted Egyptian wares included 
ivory carvings, jewellery, and of course papyrus, on 
which it virtually had a monopoly. Goods were also im ­
ported into Egypt, such as fine pottery, wine and olive oil, which was hardly produced locally. 
Alexandria did not owe its dominance in the trade net­
work of the Mediterranean solely to the beauty of its 
harbours and its large fleet, as the first­century Greek 
author Dio Chrysostom put it, but also to its position  PRAYING WOMAN

"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY68on the crossroads with the trade route to the Indian 
Ocean. Ships loaded with spices, aromatic nard, ivory, 
tortoise shell, dyes, and silk sailed back from India along 
the Red Sea, stopping at ports such as Myos Hormos and 
Berenice. These goods were transported to Alexandria, 
where a heavy imperial tax was levied, before being 
shipped across the Mediterranean. 
THE CHURCH IN EGYPT
We know relatively little about how Christianity first 
gained a foothold in Egypt, but the first converts could probably be found among the Jewish community in Alexandria in the first century AD. Following the recog­
nition of Christianity by Constantine I (r. 306–337), the 
fourth century witnessed a surge in the construction of 
churches, ranging from tiny mud­brick chapels to grand 
basilicas, often under the patronage of wealthy families. 
The Church became an economic force to be reckoned 
with. Churches functioned not only as sanctuaries but 
were also the site of organised charity work; they re ­
ceived gifts and inheritances, grants from the state, owned properties and land, and employed large num­
bers of craftsmen and tenants.
With the growth of the Church’s power came increasing 
internal struggles over what was and was not ‘correct’ 
Christianity. Church authorities tried to consolidate its 
power structure, and the Church became more and more 
institutionalised. In Egypt, Christian communities had 
been self­governing for a relatively long time, but in the 
third century the archbishop of Alexandria instated 
three bishops to preside over the priests in the hinter ­
land. By the end of the fourth century, this number had

At his feet are stylised kneeling camels, referring to the story that the camel transporting his body refused to move from the spot where his remains were to be  buried, which later became the Abu Mina pilgrimage complex near Alexandria, Egypt. Such flasks probably contained consecrated oil, water, or sand.

It is difficult to estimate the exact growth of the Chris­
tian population in Egypt, but by the end of the fourth 
century the number of people who considered them­
selves Christians had grown into a majority. Nonethe­
less, worship of the ancient gods continued well into the 
fourth century, with evidence of cultic practice at the 
temple complex of Philae (near present­day Aswan) last­
ing until the second half of the fifth. In 381, the Emperor 
Theodosius (r. 379–392) made Christianity the sole state 
religion, instating various edicts against the temples and 
non­Christian worship. Tensions between Christians 
and other groups were growing and came to a head in 
Alexandria in 391, resulting in the sack of the city’s mag ­MIXED TRADITIONS

nificent Serapeum (temple of the god Serapis). Interna­
tionally, the patriarchal see of Alexandria wielded con  ­
siderable power, and there were regular clashes with the imperial see of Constantinople. This presumably also lay 
at the basis of a notorious theological dispute on the re ­
lation between the human and divine nature of Christ.  In 451, the Council of Chalcedon decided upon a defini­
tion of two natures, which the patriarch of Alexandria 
op  posed. Despite efforts at reconciliation by several em ­
perors, this schism eventually resulted in the develop­ment of two rivalling Churches, the Chalcedonian (Mel­
kite) and anti­Chalcedonian, after the Emperor Justinian 
I (r. 527–565) appointed a Chalcedonian patriarch to 
Alexandria."
"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY70CHRISTIANISING DAILY LIFE AND DEATH
Egypt’s landscape was a reflection of its religious land­
scape, dotted with temples and shrines dedicated to vari­
ous pharaonic, Greek, Hellenised, and other imported 
divine beings. The amalgam of gods worshipped differed 
locally; there was not one coherent religion to be repla­
ced by Christianity — later Christian authors just liked to 
label everyone who did not follow their ideas ‘Hellenes’ or ‘pagans’. Often the association of a place with divine 
power lingered. Some buildings were destroyed or oth­
erwise exorcised, or given new Christian meanings as 
churches or tombs, while others were reused for their 
building materials. 
Especially in the private sphere, Christianisation did not 
eradicate familiar forms of interaction with the divine. In 
magic spells, names of Christian saints were simply add­
ed to formulas containing Egyptian, Greek, and Jewish 
elements. Ubiquitous clay figurines of women seem to 
have played an important role in private rituals related to 
maternity; they were present in households, graves, and shrines. People also visited tombs of saints believed to have healing powers, sought out monks who specialised 
in the manufacture of amulets, and paid for saintly divi­
nation by ticket oracle — often to the chagrin of Chris­
tian leaders. One pilgrimage site that was particularly well known for its healing miracles was the tomb of St 
Menas, close to Alexandria. Pilgrim flasks (ampullae) 
with consecrated oil or water allowed visitors to take some of its blessings home.  NECROPOLIS
The Bagawat necropolis is one of 
the oldest and best-preserved Christian cemeteries from the an -
cient world, located in the Kharga oasis in south-west Egypt. There are 263 mud-brick tombs in the form of funerary chapel domes, dating from the 3rd to the 7th century. Some of the tombs are decorated with frescoes depicting saints or biblical stories, e.g. Noah’s Ark as an Egyptian barque. "
"71 LATE ANTIQUE EGYPTEAGLE
Eagles were commonly depicted 
on Egyptian grave markers and on other types of sculpture, woodwork, and textiles. They were often shown holding a cross or an ankh. This awe-inspiring bird was believed to represent Christ carrying the soul of the deceased up to heaven. The eagle had a long history in Classi -
cal imagery, as a symbol of Zeus and representative of the emperor. Combined with the archway and the decorative border, the eagle makes this stela typically ‘Coptic’. Limestone, h. 43 cm, 7th cent. AD, Egypt.Numerous St­Menas flasks have been found throughout 
the Mediterranean; single examples have been uncov ­
ered as far as Meols in North West England and Samar ­
kand in modern Uzbekistan.
Christian ideas on the resurrection changed the way 
people viewed death, but there was also a great degree of 
persistence in the preferred treatment of the dead body. 
As in the Roman period, Egyptians who could afford it 
had the bodies of their loved ones wrapped in several 
layers of cloth, and bodies were still treated with natron 
and resins to ensure preservation. Specially woven red 
and brown tapes were tied in a criss­cross pattern around 
the body, echoing the more elaborate mummification 
methods of the past. From the fourth century onward  
it became customary to clothe the deceased, often in  
several garments at once, and to place accessories and 
im  ple ments of daily life in the grave. This custom con­
tinued well into the Fatimid period (tenth–twelfth cen­
tury) and is part of the reason why so many Late Antique 
textiles from Egypt have been preserved.
‘COPTIC’ ART
‘Coptic’ art is often seen as lacking in refinement and ‘naïve’ — especially when compared to more naturalistic 
styles dating to the Graeco­Roman period. It is charac­terised by a higher degree of stylisation, bright patterns, 
a lack of perspective, and large­eyed figures that are often 
depicted frontally. Despite the fact that the Egyptian 
population was overwhelmingly Christian, images from 
Hellenistic mythology were surprisingly popular in the 
fifth and sixth century. Textiles were decorated with ex ­
uberant scenes of dancing Maenads from the retinue of Dionysus, famous couples such as Apollo and Daphne, 
and frolicking winged putti (Cupids). Gods like Nilus, 
Demeter, and Aphrodite functioned as personifications 
of fertility, love, and the seasons. The chosen scenes  
em  bodied happiness and gendered virtues; they were 
probably meant to invoke the good fortune they por ­
trayed. They were clearly not thought to contradict  
with Christianity and were sometimes even combined 
with Christian symbols such as the cross. 
Although imagery was rare before the fourth century, 
the Byzantine period witnessed the development of 
Christian iconographic traditions. Particularly spectacu­lar are the fifth­ to eighth­century wall paintings that 
have been preserved in monasteries like St Apollo in 
Bawit and the Red Monastery near Sohag. Vivid paint­
ings of saints and bejewelled crosses adorned churches, chapels and monastic cells, and were obviously meant to 
inspire their occupants. Other elements are more orna­
mental, including painted columns and arches, geomet­
ric and floral motifs, and animals — although depictions 
of peacocks, eagles, and rosettes were also imbued with religious meaning and associated with Paradise."

This red tunic is special in a num -

served on ancient garments. After fulling — a rigorous form of wash -
ing that caused the wool to felt  together — the wool was teased out 
with a brush and shorn to create an even, soft pile. Secondly, this type of weave (twill) and shape are rare. Complete examples of this type have been found in children’s sizes and as undergarments, but this heavy woollen specimen shows  that they were also worn as over -
garments. A long-sleeved under -
tunic may have been worn under -
neath, but the width of the garment would have covered most of the  upper arms. The applied bands along the neck, shoulders, and  arm openings were influenced by Sassanid fashion. Moreover, the decoration on the bands in this  tunic, with its repeating motifs and animals, imitates Sassanid silks. Wool, with bands in linen and wool, h. 1 30 cm, 6th–8th cent ADMONASTICISM
One of the ways in which Egypt gained fame throughout 
the Christian world was through its monastic movement. 
Already in the third century, devout individuals adopted 
ascetic lifestyles in an attempt to fully devote themselves 
to God. This included hermits venturing out into the de ­
sert, but also others who continued to live within the confines of a village or city. Out of these un  or  ganised ef ­
forts, two separate movements developed: the anchoritic 
and the coenobitic. While the former preferred an exist­
ence that was largely solitary, the latter consisted of large 
communities of monks or nuns working, living, and 
praying together in large monastic compounds. 
A number of texts were instrumental in the spread of 
Egyptian concepts of monasticism. These include the 
Life of St Anthony, believed to have been one of the first 
monks who retreated into the desert, and the Sayings of 
the Desert Fathers, which bundled together short and 
often enigmatic teachings of Egyptian anchorites living 
in the fourth and fifth centuries. The coenobitic move­
ment gained fame primarily through the Rule of Pacho­
mius, a list of regulations dictating the daily routine in 
the Pach  omian monasteries. These ranged from what a 
sick monk was allowed to eat to an admonition not to 
hike your robe up too high while doing laundry. These 
dos and don’ts seem trivial, but ensured equality and 
concord among the large numbers of monks living to ­
gether. Translations of these texts and other descriptions of Egyptian monastic life would inspire monks and ordi­
nary Christians in Europe and beyond for centuries to 
come.THE ARAB CONQUEST
The second half of the sixth century and first half of the 
seventh were particularly tumultuous. The Byzantine 
Empire suffered under a plague pandemic and droughts. 
At the same time, the power of the Sassanid Persians was 
growing, and in 619 they conquered Alexandria. They 
only stayed in power for a decade and had to cede Egypt 
to the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) in 628. 
One of the most momentous events in Egyptian history 
followed only a few years later, as Amr ibn al­ As led the 
Arab armies into Egypt in 639. They took Alexandria in 641 and conquered the rest of the country in stages dur ­
ing the following years, despite Byzantine efforts to re ­
gain Egypt in 645 and 654. 
The Arabs settled in the newly founded garrison town of 
Fustat, today absorbed in the urban sprawl of Cairo. The 
commanders did not want to set up camp in Alexandria, because it was vulnerable to attack from the sea and for 
fear of their soldiers getting too comfortable among its alluring attractions. The new Arab rulers maintained the 
existing administrative system, although they placed it 
under strict supervision by Arab officials. In the first cen­
tury of Arab rule there was relatively little settlement in "

LIVING TOGETHER
It is a common misconception that the Arabs intended 
to convert the countries they conquered. Early policies 
were geared toward segregating the Muslim armies and 
ensuring tax revenues. ‘People of the Book’, Jews and 
Christians, were granted freedom of worship, as long as 
they paid the poll tax and subjected themselves to Mus­
lim rule. They were called dhimmi, the protected. Con­
version was only encouraged from the eighth century the hinterland, but Fustat quickly exploded in size. The diwan, the main administrative office, was established 
here, as well as the first mosque. Arab settlers were allot­
ted pieces of land and their families quickly joined them, resulting in overcrowded tribal quarters.
Its wealth and strategic position made Egypt a prize to 
the newly fledged Arab Empire, and control over Egypt 
played a critical role in the first two internal wars of suc­
cession. Like the Roman emperors in the past, the ca ­
liphs had to be careful whom they put in charge of this province. The caliphal seat was in Damascus under the 
Umayyad dynasty (661–750) and subsequently in Bagh­
dad and Samarra under the Abbasids (750–969), too far 
to exercise direct control. They gave high­ranking posi­
tions to the local Arab elite to avoid dissension while 
trying to maintain control by sending their own gover ­
nor. Twice these governors managed to establish inde­pendence when the Abbasid caliphs were preoccupied 
with other quarrels: under the Tulunids (868–905) and 
the Ikhshidids (935–969). "

ginning, as it meant losing the support of one’s previous 
social networks and did not necessarily result in accepta­
tion among one’s new fellow ­believers.
Tax increases were probably at the heart of a number of local revolts that broke out between the end of the sev ­
enth century and first half of the ninth. Tax payment was checked in more efficient and oppressive ways, through 
land and cattle surveys, and even with lead neck ­seals 
that certified that an individual had paid. The unrest was probably also related to the further centralisation and 
Arabisation of the system, in which some of the local 
overseers (pagarchs) were replaced by Arabs. Moreover, 
as Arabs were increasingly settling in the hinterland 
from the eighth century onward, local Christian elites 
saw their position threatened as both land holders and 
tax overseers. 
Christians and Muslims were increasingly sharing close 
quarters, which sometimes led to tensions. Caliph al­
Mutawakkil (r. 847–861) was one of the first rulers who 
attempted to enforce segregation by instating discrimi­
natory laws. He decreed, among other things, that dhim­ mi were not allowed to work in government, that they 
had to wear certain yellow garments and a belt, and that 
new churches had to be torn down. These and later 
decrees referred back to the Pact of Umar, a text attrib­
uted to Umar ibn al Khattab (r. 634–644) but more likely 
conceived in the eighth century. It included sartorial 
rules to ensure distinction and restricted non­Muslim 
religious practice in public. It was not until the tenth 
century that similar decrees were again issued, and it is 
unclear where and for how long these laws were actually 
enforced. When they were, it left Christians and Jews 
vulnerable to harassment and resulted in waves of con­
versions.
MATERIAL ACCULTURATION
There was a great degree of continuity in material culture from the Byzantine to the early Islamic period, with no 
indication of a break. Like before, Egypt’s high­quality 
linens were renowned throughout the region. Its ship­
ments of wheat were now rerouted to Mecca and Me  di­
 na. The Abbasids dramatically expanded trade with the 
East, by opening a direct trade route from what is now 
Iraq to the Indus Valley and China. This is apparent, for 
example, in the ubiquity of Chinese ceramics and the 
increased use of lac dye from south­east Asia in textiles. 
The Abbasids emulated the Persians in many ways, but they also developed their own distinct ‘Samarra’ style, characterised by bevelled­cut surfaces and repeating  
geometric and vegetal motifs (arabesques). Similarly,  
lustreware ceramics, decorated with a metallic glaze to 
resemble silver and gold vessels, were eagerly adopted 
throughout the caliphate.
The Arab love of calligraphy also found expression in 
textiles. At the Umayyad court, luxurious garments 
made in caliphal workshops were given to loyal subjects 
as a sign of royal favour. These textiles were adorned 
with a standardised formula of praise and requests for 
blessings that included the name of the caliph, the place 
of manufacture, and sometimes even a date. Both the 
embroidered or tapestry ­woven lines of writing and the 
workshops — many of which were located in Egypt —  
were referred to as tiraz. This practice continued under 
the Abbasids, and these obvious status symbols were soon emulated outside court circles. In fact, one of the 
earliest known examples from Egypt was ordered by a 
Christian called Samuel son of Marc.
In addition to signs of acculturation between Muslims 
and Christians, there are also indications of a growing 
Christian self­awareness. For example, in the seventh 
century tapestry ornaments with Biblical scenes became 
popular, depicting e.g. passages from the stories of Jo ­
seph or David, or the Nativity. Moreover, despite the fact that Christians did wear tiraz in Arabic, a parallel Chris­
tian version developed with texts in Coptic and Greek, 
some of which even include sections from psalms. 
EPILOGUE: FATIMID EGYPT
The tenth century tipped the scales in terms of Arabisa­
tion and Islamisation. By this time, contracts were com­
monly written in Arabic and the first Arabic translations 
of the Bible appeared. At the same time, the conquest of 
Egypt by the Shi’ite Fatimid dynasty in 969 heralded an 
era of prosperity. The Fatimids established their court in

ROMAN MILESTONE
From Egeria’s travelogue: ‘As we travelled 
along, the local presbyter from Livias (we had asked him to leave his home and ac -
company us because he knew the area so well) asked, “Would you like to see the  water that flows from the rock, which Moses gave to the children of Israel when they  were thirsty? You can if you have the energy to turn off the road at about the sixth  milestone.”’The Romans marked the most important roads with milestones, 1 Roman mile  measuring c. 1,481 m. The inscription on  the stone recorded the distance, the towns connected by the road, the name of the man who had had it constructed, and the name  of the emperor in whose name it was done: every milestone was a piece of imperial  propaganda. Milestone, 2nd cent. AD, found near Mount Nebo. These words belong to a woman named 
Egeria, who went on an extended pil -
grimage of Christian holy sites in the eastern Mediterranean in the late 
fourth century AD. From c.381 to 384, 
she journeyed over 5000 kilometres, 
from Constantinople (modern Istanbul, 
Turkey) to Jerusalem, and then to Egypt and Mesopotamia (present-day Syria 
and Turkey), visiting sites of signifi -
cance to the story of Christianity. She recorded her obser  vations as a letter 
home to her fellow-nuns (‘sisters’), so that her eye-witness descriptions of 
places might enhance their understan -
ding of Scripture. She also descri bed  
in detail the rituals performed at the 
churches in Jerusalem, so that her sis-ters might gain knowledge of how the 
Christian rites were performed in the 
very places where biblical events took 
place. 
Egeria by her own admission is inquisi -
tive: she asks questions about the places and their links to Bible stories, and about the lifestyle of the monks she  
visits. At each site, she reads out rele -
vant Bible passages: at Mount Sinai she reads from the Book of Moses, and 
near the tomb of Moses (Mount Nebo, 
Jordan) reads out from the Book of 
Deuteronomy at the very spot where  it was said to have been composed.  
At Edessa (S ¸anlıurfa, Turkey) Egeria is 
shown the legendary letter from Jesus 
to King Abgar — she astutely notes that 
this original is longer than the copy in her library at home. She is keen to ac  cu -
rately describe landscapes as well as sounds and smells for her audience 
back home.Egeria’s journey was facilitated by  
the well-integrated Roman imperial 
road system. The Roman Empire was 
connected by a vast expanse of road -
ways that were maintained into the fourth century and beyond. These roads 
were mainly for imperial and military communications — particularly the 
high-speed messenger service called 
the cursus publicus — but ordinary  
travellers like Egeria benefited from  the facilities, especially the inns (man ­
siones ). Egeria travelled through more 
dangerous areas with a military escort. 
She carefully recorded the distances 
between sites in Roman miles; this was made possible by road-side milestones GALICIA CONSTANTINOPLE 3.871 km 
CROSSROADS DIVERSITY 76"
"that gave the distances to destinations 
and served as landmarks. 
Egeria’s journey was also facilitated  
by the extensive social network of the 
Christian Church. Everywhere she went, 
Egeria was met by bishops and monks 
who greeted her hospitably. They 
answered her questions about the sites, about spiritual life and Scripture, and 
offered her gifts (what she calls eulo ­
giae , ‘blessings’) in the form of fruits 
from their gardens. Christian pilgrims 
may still have been something of a nov -
elty in Egeria’s day, but over the next century pilgrimage would surge in pop -
ularity. The Church would take the lead in providing hospitality, driven by Chris   tian moral obligations of charity 
and the need for appropriate lodgings 
for spiritually-minded travellers.
But who was Egeria, and where did she 
come from? The text does not tell us.  
A seventh-century letter by a Spanish 
monk, Valerius, provides her name and suggests that she came from what is now Galicia in north-west Spain. She 
may have travelled independently to  
the East — a document from AD 333 
known as the Bordeaux Itinerary sets out a possible overland route across 
Europe and the Levant to Jerusalem.  
It has been speculated that Egeria was connected to the court of the Emperor 
Theodosius I (r. 379–395), who also 
came from Spain. Theodosius I was the 
last emperor to rule over both the east -
ern and western halves of the Roman Empire. He enacted legislation forbid -
ding pagan sacrifices and promoted Nicene Christianity (see Heather’s con -
tribution) in an effort to unify Chris-
tians. Egeria’s writing represents a 
changing world view, where the Chris-
tian topography of holy places and holy 
people would define the perception of 
the eastern provinces of the Roman Em  -
pire and cement the status of the Holy Land in the medieval imagination.

"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY78One of the great characteristics of Irish art is timeless­
ness. Located seemingly on the edge of the world and 
associated with the ancient Celts, the Irish and their art 
have been bound up with ideas of magic and mystery for 
centuries. Ireland’s place in Europe in the Early Middle 
Ages was like a sanctuary; isolated and viewed from afar 
as a distant landscape inhabited by ancient tribes and 
chieftains. 
Despite feeling distant, Ireland had a strong relationship 
with Europe during the Early Middle Ages. These links 
extend to Irish scholars who travelled to Europe, creat­
ing connections through knowledge, art, and learning. 
These connections are (sometimes literally) written on 
the landscape in the form of monuments and architec­
ture, in history books, and in museum showcases: man­
uscript illumination and artistic detailing of metal and 
stone artefacts all speak to this unique combination of 
strong local and ancient forms, and their influence on 
early ­medieval taste, form and meaning. 
Irish sea­going traders play a large role in the early part  
of this story. They established bases along the western 
seaboard of Scotland, Wales and Cornwall, leaving bread ­
crumbs of their visits in the form of Ogham stones: early 
Irish carvings that were used to demarcate boundaries. In 
fact, the Latin term ‘Scotti’ refers to the Gaelic­speaking people of Ireland and the Irish who settled in western Scotland. The Irish left traces of their travels, but they 
brought evidence of their journeys back to Ireland as well. 
One Romano­British slave brought back to Ireland —  a 
Welshman called Patrick — would form some of the earli­
est Christian communities, and would go down in history 
as one of the most venerated and popular Irish saints.IRELAND

"79 IRELAND AND EUROPE: TRANSMISSION OF CELTIC AESTHETIC IN THE EARLY MIDDLE AGESBut the contact was not limited to the Irish leaving and 
taking bits of culture; European culture came to Ireland 
as well. The popes sent Christian missionaries — such as 
Palladius, sent by Celestine I in 431 — from Romanised 
Europe to minister to the native Christian clergy. This is 
known because of the records later written by the Vener ­
able Bede in 670. This was truly a period of contact and exchange. 
And with all this exchange, an identifiable Celtic aes­
thetic developed in the visual arts. This is generally 
described as Insular art, which became a characteristic 
feature of the ‘Hiberno­Scottish Mission’. This mission 
was characterised by Irish monks hailing from Ireland 
and western Scotland who contributed to the spread of 
Christianity to continental Europe. Art would become 
one of Ireland’s greatest contributions to medieval 
Europe — to the scholarship, culture, and faith — as con­
nections between Ireland and the Continent grew. In ­
deed these pieces of art are an essential source of infor ­
mation about the period, reflecting changes in religion, culture, contact, and even politics. These objects reveal 
the exchange of artistic and creative ideas, affecting the move from abstraction to figural decoration arriving in 
Europe during the Early Middle Ages; a style that would 
become apparent most notably in the Merovingian and 
Carolingian Frankish realm as well as the Holy Roman 
Empire. 
Recent studies have emphasised the early ­medieval ar  ­
tis  tic influence and have shown how it has shaped cur ­
rent ideas of what it means to be Irish in Europe. In this 
period, however, art relied on connections to the Conti­
nent. Reliance on traditional maritime and pilgrimage 
routes for transmission of new ideas and artistic currents 
was essential. These routes did not only affect artistic 
styles, but spread ideas, knowledge and scholarship. 
ST COLUMBA: THE IRISH MISSION AND EUROPE
Insula sanctorum et doctorum (‘island of saints and scholars’), as Ireland was known, referred to scholars  
and migrants who were associated with the foundation 
of monasteries. This Insular mission was associated with 
an evolving network of knowledge exchange between 
monastic complexes, many of which arose from commu­
nities that developed in Ireland. 
St Columba (521–597) is one of the most important ex ­
amples for the history of Ireland. He founded monaster ­
ies in Derry and Durrow from the sixth century and was 
credited with spreading Christianity to sites in  Scotland, England and the Continent. From Iona (597)  
to Lindisfarne (615), these religious houses were a  
considerable political presence in the region. To illus­
trate this point, one only needs to look at St Fursey 
(c.597–650), who according to Bede brought Christianity 
to East Anglia (UK) by converting king Sigbert.
Many of the sources from this period are hagiographies: 
lives of the saints. The Life of Columba by Adoman is an 
ST COLUMBANUS
Columbanus (543–6 1 5) was ac -
tive as a missionary in early-medie -
val Europe. He founded a number 
of monasteries in the Frankish and Longobard kingdoms, most nota -
bly Luxeuil Abbey in France and Bobbio Abbey in Italy, where to -gether with the Longobard queen Theodelinda Columbanus success-fully fought Arianism. This fresco of St Columbanus giving his blessing, in Brugnato Cathedral, Italy, was painted in the 1 4th century."
"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY80example that has influenced our understanding of this 
period. In addition to documenting Columba’s life, this 
text established the cult of saints.  
St Columbanus (543–615) is an important figure in Irish 
history, but also in the history of Christianity in Europe. 
He established a continental network close to Reims —  
important for its political connotations as the coronation site of the Frankish kings. Additionally, he founded 
monasteries at Luxeuil (c.585–590), having first settled at 
Annegray in the Vosges, eastern France. 
It is because of these connections that Irish Christianity 
gained a foothold in Europe. St Fiachra (d. 670) of Breuil 
was welcomed by Clovis II; St Foillan (d. 652) established 
houses in Belgium. As a result, reliquary objects made 
their way to the continent, such as the Tongeren Horn. 
Such a piece is an example of portable high­status eccle­
siastical objects; the product of Irish craftsmanship made 
for export. 
Further afield monasteries of Irish origin developed at 
Bobbio, Italy (615), St Gall Switzerland (630), Reichenau, 
Germany, and so­called Scotti monasteries in Germany and Austria. These activities were recorded by another 
early biographer of Columbanus, Jonas of Bobbio. With 
the foundation of St Gall, the presence of these great 
Irish founders was firmly felt. St Killian of Würzburg  
(d. 689) and St Fergal or Virgilius of Salzburg (d. 784) 
were also part of the first wave of missionary mi  grants to 
Europe, and with them they brought literacy and learn­ing of manuscripts. At this time, the rules and behaviour 
that governed the monasteries (such as Lux   euil and Bob­
bio) was derived from Celtic traditions. At Bobbio, for 
instance, they followed the teaching of the church 
known as the Rule of St Columban.
The Celtic connections can be felt in the physical spaces of the monasteries. The library at Bobbio was a signifi­
cant repository of manuscripts brought from Ireland.  
A brilliant example is the Bangor Antiphony, a short 
manuscript of 36 leaves, with sets of collects (a type of 
prayer) used at each hour. The St Gall monastery —  
named after St Gall (c.550–646), one of the twelve com­panions of Columbanus when he went to the conti­
nent — is a testimony to this. The St Gall Stifts bibliotek 
TONGEREN HORN
This Irish horn once served as a rel -
iquary. It was preserved in the Be -
guinage of Tongeren (Belgium). In 
pagan times it was no doubt used for sacrificial practices or swearing oaths. The horn was likely brought to northern France as a result of  ecclesiastical connections with  the west of Ireland after the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in the 1 2th century. Horn, l. 42 cm, date unknown."
"81holds spectacular Insular manuscripts such as the 
eighth­century Peccavimus Parcuri missal. The libraries 
associated with these monastic settlements would be ­
come centres of ecclesiastical learning, repositories of biblical commentaries and hagiographies. 
From metalwork to sculpture, the cult of saints — be   gin ­
ning with Columba — was a catalyst for creativity. Some 
of the best­known objects of this period are connected 
to the veneration of saints. The Book of Durrow (c.700) 
was associated with Columba’s cult, although stylisti­
cally it makes reference to classical and Anglo­Saxon art. 
The Book of Kells (c.800) was also associated with Col ­
umban churches. Once it had a cover that protected the decorated book cover and the lavishly decorated illustra­
tions, beautiful as well as historically significant: the Vir ­
gin and Child is one of the earliest representations of this scene in Western art and refers to Byzantine sources. 
Connections through ecclesiastical objects to the wider 
early ­medieval world can be seen in another example, 
the Ardagh Chalice (eighth/ninth century). This is one of the great treasures of Insular metalwork, fusing differ ­
ent decorative strands of interlaced, geometric pattern­
ing, Anglo­Saxon and Germanic zoomorphic detailing 
and Celtic La Tène art styles. 
The importance of the cult of saints in Ireland can be 
seen in the reliquaries: portable containers of saints’  
relics holding miraculous powers. The cult of St Colum­
 ba is represented by the small tomb­shaped shrine of 
Monymusk, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. This eighth­cen­
tury shrine is enamelled and carries animal ornament as 
a more developed form of Insular art. Tomb­shaped reli­
quaries found in several locations point to a common 
stylistic production. For instance, the Clonmore shrine 
(Blackwater, early seventh century) is closely related to 
the Bobbio house shrine. Likewise, these reliquaries are 
also connected to the wider artist web in Ireland: the 
engraving on the surface of the Clonmore shrine is close 
to the illumination in the Book of Durrow, a later ­sev ­
enth­century gospel book. The discussion of religion and art cannot be completed 
without mentioning the iconic Irish High Crosses (such 
as those from Clonmacnoise). These monuments acted 
as boundary markers for the early Christian monastery as they were situated on the edge of the sanctuary. They 
used iconography from the New and Old Testaments  
to present biblical lessons for those who had no access  
to the texts. CONTACT AND CONNECTIONS:  
THE VIKING AGE AND BEYOND
Long­distance trade routes connected people across 
many different ethnic boundaries in this globalised 
medieval world in Europe. The Church was a stimulating 
force in terms of international dynamics in western Eu ­
rope in the Early Middle Ages, although Irish mission activities certainly helped it along. 
We have evidence for these long­distance trade routes 
through archaeological and art­historical evidence. The 
benefit of trade routes across Europe can be seen in craft 
production, which used rare minerals from Mount Vesu­
vius, Italy, in ink for manuscript illumination. From the 
mid­ninth century, archaeological evidence attests to 
trade links between northern Europe and Iberia, as silver 
dirham coins minted at Cordoba in al­ Andalus (Islamic 
Spain), circulated in Waterford, Ireland. Trade routes such as these would encourage settlements of Vikings 
due to the establishment of trade outposts, along Ire­
land’s eastern seaboard (notably at Waterford, Wexford, 
Dublin).
The coming of the Vikings from northern regions was 
firmly marked by an entry in the Annals of Ulster in 795 
that referred to Viking raiders on the island of Skye in 
Scotland and on Rathlin in Ireland. The references re ­
flected the stark sense of invasion as pagans are described as geinnti or gaill (not God’s people). Repeated attacks MOYLOUGH BELT

Iona returned to Ireland when their monastery was 
raided, resulting in the establishment of a new monastic 
settlement at Kells, Co. Meath. In honour of the new 
monastery, the Book of Kells was completed and a high 
cross raised to mark the significant occasion of return of 
Columban relics to Ireland. 
The impact of Viking incursions meant that ecclesiastical 
artefacts and manuscript illumination reflected a shift in 
stylistic focus in terms of production. Acculturation was 
apparent in objects associated with the growing Viking 
settlements at Waterford, Wexford and Dublin. This can 
be seen even in personal adornment: a shift from penan­
nular brooches to different forms of ring pins, arm rings 
and kite brooches. The applied arts showed a stylistic 
change which can be seen in the imported Urnes and 
Ringerrike styles. Numerous Viking silver hoards com­CROSS OF THE SCRIPTURES
The monastery of Clonmacnoise, 
Co. Offaly, was founded in 544.  Its strategic location helped it be -
come a major centre of religion, learning, craftsmanship and trade by the 9th century. Together with Clonard it was the most famous in Ireland, visited by scholars from all over Europe. The surface of the Cross of the Scriptures is divided into panels with figured scenes. The Crucifixion, the Last Judge -
ment and Christ in the Tomb are biblical, and the lowest scene on the east face of the shaft shows an ecclesiastic and a king driving a pole into the ground. This may rep -

such as in Balline, Co. Limerick.
A new wave of migration to Europe from Ireland was  
felt as a result of the Viking incursions to Ireland. Never ­
theless, there is evidence for coexistence within Ireland. Especially for monastic communities, survival meant 
coexistence, and we see churches and monasteries grow ­
ing side by side in settlements. Such an example can be found in Dublin, where Christchurch Cathedral was 
founded by Viking king and Irish archbishop alike.
IRISH SCHOLARSHIP AND THE CAROLINGIAN 
RENAISSANCE
The intellectual impact of this movement of scholars  
and monks moving away from Ireland was apparent  
at the court of Charlemagne. In fact, it was one of the 
contributing factors of the Carolingian Renaissance. 
Einhard’s biography, The Life of Charlemagne, describes 
the revival of Latin learning in the West as a renovatio. Church reform was part of this. The Carolingian reformer 
Benedict of Aniane (d. 821) produced a collection of all 
monastic rules, including the Irish Columban rules. 
Irish intellectual achievement made a mark on European 
culture as knowledge was imported to Europe and Irish 
dignitaries served at European courts: Sedulius Scottus 
(fl. 840–860) at the Liège court and John Scotus Eriugena 
(c.815–c.877) at the Palace School of Charles the Bald. 
Irish scholars were also widely praised for their experi­
ence and were written about in annals. For example, Sig­
ramn, an Aquitanian noble from Bourges, mentioned ‘a 
certain bishop from the regions of Ireland, a man by the 
name of Falvius, who experienced to the fullest in saintly 
acts’. The St Gall monk Notker the Stammerer (c.840–
912) in Deeds of Charlemagne so impressed Charle magne 
that he gained a new appreciation for Irish scholars and 
their wisdom and knowledge. A famous quote from the 
papal librarian Anastasius refers to Irish scholar John 
Scottus Eriugena (860): ‘It is a wonderful thing how that 
barbarian, living at the ends of the earth, who might be 
supposed to be as far removed from the knowledge of 
this other language as he is from familiar use of it, has 
been able to comprehend such ideas and translate them 
into another tongue.’ Irishness became a link to scholarly 
excellence at the right time: when the Carolingian courts 
reflected Charlemagne’s appreciation of education. In 
c.800 AD Charlemagne appointed the Irish scholar Dun­
gal of Pavia to assist in the organisation of education in 
Italy. ST PATRICK’S BELL
St Patrick’s Bell or the ‘Bell of St 
Patrick’s Will’ was one of the great treasures of the medieval church  of Armagh. Around AD 1 100 an elaborate shrine was made to keep this bell, thanks to the patronage of Domhnall Ua Loch  lainn, then high 
king of Ireland. The shrine housed the much earlier bell that was re -
puted to have belonged to St Pat -
rick (d. 46 1) and is one of the finest examples of the Irish version of the distinctive Scandinavian Urnes art style. Apparently, at the beginning of the 20th century, there was a good reason to make a replica of this early-medieval treasure. This replica is now a treasure in its own right and is kept at the Metropoli -
tan Museum of Art in New York. Gilt silver, mark of Edmond John -

St Kevin’s Church is the only stone-

porates a croft between the barrel-

world, as it was a part of the Roman Empire. The Irish 
connections to Latin literacy were significant, since Latin 
was the language of the Holy Scriptures. It was against 
the Irish scholars that others came to be measured. At 
the imperial abbey of Reichenau, one monastic scribe, 
Walafrid Strabo (d. 849), conjured up an image of the 
Continent being full of Irish de natione Scottorum to 
whom the ‘custom to travel had become almost second 
nature’. Irish travellers were described as ‘ the bright 
flame (…) [that] has risen to the skies, these are the  
illustrious saints whom our noble island of Hibernia 
reared as her glorious children; whose grateful faith,  
virtue, honour and blameless life hallowed these lofty 
palaces and beautiful houses’. 
Just as art, literature, and ecclesiastical objects in Ireland 
saw a change in style and production with the impact of 
Viking incursions, changes on a similar scale occurred 
because of the strong connection with Europe in the Carolingian period. The influx of Irish culture into Europe had an impact on applied arts and architecture, 
but the largest impact was felt on scholarship; the Irish 
achievement found a place with western European cul ­
ture during the Carolingian reforms and beyond, form­ing a part of a European pool of learning. Ireland’s sobri­
quet ‘island of saints and scholars’ stems from this peri­  
 od, when scholars and missionaries from Ireland exerted 
great influence on continental Europe. The leg  acy of this 
period has remained even to this day."

A NEW PHASE
A third phase of influence was felt in the eleventh and 
twelfth centuries. This period was likewise a time of 
travel and exchange as pilgrimage became ever more 
popular. Travellers and pilgrims went to Rome and  
Santiago de Compostela, carrying souvenir shells and 
pilgrim’s flasks with them. Along with physical objects, 
they also carried with them ideas that, disseminated  
by churchmen, would instigate church reform. 
As can be expected, art and architecture changed with 
the movement of people. The specific evolution of a 
Hiberno­Romanesque architecture is manifest in Cor ­
mac’s Chapel, Cashel. It is an example of the flourishing of newly reformed Cistercian architecture, which inspi ­
red new building forms in Ireland. Church reform penetrated Ireland with a sphere of in­ 
fl  uence from the papacy in Rome. With these changes 
came changes in the landscape. The Irish church refor­mer St Malachy, archbishop of Armagh and a friend of St 
Bernard of Clairvaux, also introduced reforms in monas­
tic architecture at Mellifont Abbey and St Mary’s Abbey 
in Dublin in 1141 and 1142. 
The dawning of a new age in early ­medieval cultural  
history was reflected in an enlightened visual literacy from the centre to the margins, brought about by pan­
European interaction and an exchange of shared Euro­
pean patrimony.

NORTH  
ATLANTIC AND BLACK SEA
THE VIKING AGE  
AND KIEVAN RUS
Matthias Toplak
The Viking Age is the period from the eighth to the  
eleventh century AD in northern Europe, the era of 
Scandinavian expansion. Warlike Norsemen spread over 
the European world, plundering monasteries, cities and 
market towns and establishing a trade network that 
spanned almost the entire world then known in Europe. 
One of the first recorded and most influential early con­
tacts between Christendom and the Nordic marauders 
was the raid on the monastery of Lindisfarne off the 
Northumbrian coast (England) on 8 June 793. This inci­
sive event marks the beginning of the Viking Age and 
explains its name: viking in Old Norse means ‘raid’. 
These eponymous looting expeditions, however, were just one aspect of the Viking Age. Relatively few men 
took part in each of the often lucrative but equally peril­
ous adventures during the summer months in order to 
gain renown and riches with an opportunistic combina­
tion of trade, exacting tribute, and plundering. Therefore 
calling the Danes, Norwegians, Swedes and Icelanders of the late first millennium ‘Vikings’ really is an unjust gen­
eralisation. Most of these men were peasants, fishermen, 
merchants or craftsmen; not the cruel, wild and uncul­
tured warriors and pirates they are often thought to have 
been. For want of a better word, ‘Viking’ nevertheless is 
the common name for Scandinavian culture and society 
from the eighth to the eleventh century. 
Many everyday objects from the Viking Age testify to a 
highly developed sense of art. Even the simplest uten­
sils, such as pottery or wooden tableware, often were 
elaborately decorated with winding patterns that had 
developed from a mix of Germanic animal motifs and 
influences from different artistic traditions: Celtic, Anglo­Saxon, and even Mediterranean.
Viking­ Age art can be arranged in a loose chronological 
sequence of six style phases; what they all have in com­mon is the winding decorations based on stylised vine 
and animal motifs that occur in metalwork, woodcarv ­
ing, embroidery, and stonework. Contemporary rune­stones — memorial stones, often exquisitely decorated, 
with inscriptions in runic script — as well as the compli­
cated skaldic poetry handed down in the Old Norse 
sagas of the High Middle Ages testify to the store the 
Vikings set by poetry and elaborate wordplay. This ap ­
pre ciation of art and sophisticated design is also visible 
in Viking­ Age craft. Viking craftsmen used highly devel­
oped metallurgic techniques seen especially in gold jew ­
ellery and ship construction. From the rowing boats of 
the north­European Iron Age, which were already 
clinker ­built (i.e. with overlapping boards), Viking  
shipbuilders created the square­rigged longship, which 
despite its shallow draft and open construction made it possible to cross the North Atlantic. 
THE WORLD OF THE VIKINGS
The development of the fast, easily manoeuvrable yet 
seaworthy longships, combined with the Scandinavians’ 
impressive nautical skills, allowed a unique expansion of 
their range of action. It reached from the east coast of 
modern North America over the North Atlantic islands 
and Scandinavia to the Eurasian steppe and the Caspian 
Sea. The seasonal raids by small bands on the coasts of THE OSEBERG SHIP
In the early 20th century an excep -
tional discovery was made in a 
grave mound at the Oslo Fjord (Norway): the Oseberg Ship. In it two high-ranking women had been buried in the first half of the 9th century; their opulent grave goods included wooden furniture with ex -quisitely carved decorations. The longship, 22 m long and clinker-built from oak, has fine carvings on bow and stern. Judging from its slim shape and unusually shallow draft it probably was not seaworthy, but was used as a luxury yacht for trips near the coast. "
"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY88Anglo­Saxon England and the Frankish kingdom gradu­
ally turned into large­scale undertakings in which local 
chiefs, often Danes, joined forces. From the mid­ninth 
century, a group of several thousand warriors (‘a big hea ­
then army’, according to the Anglo­Saxon Chronicle) ransacked and conquered large parts of England; numer ­
ous Scandinavian families settled in this area called Da ­
nelag, ‘where Danish law rules’. Many geographical 
names in north­east England still point to these Scandi­
navian immigrants.
By the end of the ninth century the Anglo­Saxon king 
Alfred the Great (r. 871–899) succeeded in driving back 
the Viking army. Most of the Danish warriors crossed 
the Channel to raid the coasts of northern France and Flanders. Entire fleets used the domestic weakness of the Frankish kingdom to sail inland over the great rivers and 
pillage the cities along Rhine, Meuse and Seine. The  
constant Viking threat prompted Charles the Simple

to protect the coastal region, known from then on as 
Normandy, from further raids. At the end of the tenth 
century, during the reign of the Danish king Svein Fork ­
beard (r. 986–1014), raids on England were resumed and led to its conquest in 1013. Sveyn was succeeded by his 
son Canute the Great (r. 1016–1035), whose kingdom is 
known as the North Sea Empire and constituted the 
largest territory of the Viking Age, comprising Denmark, 
parts of south Sweden, Norway, and England.
Ireland and Scotland had likewise been subjected to 
plundering by the Vikings from the end of the eighth 
century onward and were later colonised, as were the 
Orkneys. In Ireland several territories were established, 
among them the Kingdom of Dublin, which centred on 
the trade centre founded by the Vikings and was a force 
to be reckoned with in the tenth century.
Starting from Norway and the Norse settlements in  
Ireland, the Vikings opened up the North Atlantic in the 
ninth century as they took land on the Faroe and Shet­
land Islands and discovered and colonised Iceland. While 
in most of the new Viking territories monarchies were established, Iceland developed a form of parliamentary 
democracy, with the alþing in Þingvellir as the legislative 
and judicial assembly of all free men. Around AD 1000 it 
decided to convert to Christianity. For several centuries 
Icelandic settlements existed on Greenland as well; again 
around the turn of the millennium, they were the start­
ing point for Leif Eriksson’s (c.970–1020) discovery of 
what is now North America. Leif’s father, Erik the Red 
(c.950–c.1003), had discovered Greenland two decades 
earlier and initiated settlement there. An attempt to  
settle in present­day Newfoundland failed in an early 
stage. Although the Greenland settlers incidentally 
sailed to the east coast of North America for resources 
such as timber, their discovery of what they called  
Vínland (‘land of wine’, sometimes interpreted as Vin­
land, ‘land of pasture’) was just a brief episode without 
consequences in the history of Viking expansion in the  
North Atlantic. 
BETWEEN HAMMER AND CROSS: THE  
CHRISTIANISATION OF SCANDINAVIA 
As their contacts with medieval Christian Europe inten­
sified, the Vikings’ society changed as well; theirs was an 
age of transformation. At the end of the tenth century, 
supraregional kingdoms grew from the rural tribal com­
munities of local kings: the origins of the modern states of Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Their kings were in ­
creasingly orientated to their powerful neighbours in 
the south, the Franks and later the Holy Roman Empire. 
By the end of the Viking Age in the second half of the 
eleventh century they had been completely integrated 
into the political system of Christian Europe. Christian­
ity had already found its way north by then. Already in 
the early Viking Age, lone missionaries such as St Ansgar 
(801–865), the ‘Apostle of the North’ who later became 
the archbishop of Hamburg­Bremen, tried to wrest the 
pagan Scandinavians from their faith in Odin and Thor and bring them into the fold of the Church. But it was 
only in the second half of the tenth century that the 
Danish king Harald Bluetooth (r. c.958–986) introduced 
Christianity into his realm and stated on the famous 
runestone of Jelling (Denmark, c.965) that he ‘had 
turned the Danes into Christians’. Harald probably had 
himself baptised out of political calculation rather than ACHIEVEMENT
The big runestone of Jelling (Den -
mark) was erected by King Harald 
Bluetooth, probably c. AD 965. The inscription states that Harald Christianised Denmark. The stone, which has a large figure of Christ on one of its faces, is also called ‘Denmark’s baptismal certificate’.

"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY90deep conviction, but his baptism heralded the beginning 
of Scandinavia’s Christianisation nonetheless. The new 
faith did not have much impact on most people’s daily 
lives, but as churches and monasteries were founded,  
literacy and historiography arrived in their wake. Ar  ­
chaeological finds prove that already before the Viking 
Age there existed regular and intensive trade contacts 
between Scandinavia and central Europe. With the 
Vikings’ expansion, however, widely ramified trade  
networks were established that reached even the Arab 
world. The big, early ­urban trading centres that devel­
oped — e.g. Hedeby near Schleswig (Germany), Ribe 
(Denmark), and Birka in Lake Mälaren (Sweden) —  ser ­
ved as transfer locations for goods and merchants, but 
also for religious and cultural ideas and created the basis 
for Scandinavia’s urbanisation with cities such as Lund,  
Sigtuna (Sweden), Bergen or Nidaros/Trondheim (Nor ­
way). Trading on the big markets of Constantinople (Turkey) and Baghdad (Iraq) was particularly lucrative 
for the Norsemen, who would exchange skins, fur and 
slaves for luxury commodities such as silk, spices, and silver coins as a raw material for jewellery. These com­mercial interests led to an eastward expansion of the 
Viking world and to the birth of another kingdom of  
the Viking Age, Kievan Rus.
FROM THE VARANGIANS TO THE GREEKS:  
KIEVAN RUS
From the mid­eighth century AD there is evidence of a 
Scandinavian presence in what is now north­west Rus­
sia. Merchants from Denmark, the Swedish island Got­
land and in particular central Sweden, who were called 
Rus or Varangians, used the market of the native Balto­
Finnic peoples of Staraya Ladoga (Russia) as the starting 
point of a trading network that ran from the dense for ­
ests of north­west Russia to the Caspian Sea. Over the Volga the Rus reached the markets of Bolghar and Atil 
(Russia) in the territory of the Volga Bulgars and the 
Khazars (a semi­nomadic Turkic people) respectively, 
and from the Caspian Sea they travelled by land to Bagh­
dad, the capital of the Arab Abbasid Caliphate. Toward 
the end of the ninth century the Rus’ trade routes "

Present-day Rurikovo Gorodishche

shifted from the Volga to the Dnieper, the route to the 
Black Sea with Kiev (Ukraine), the centre of Rus political 
power, on its banks. The Rus thus had a direct connec­
tion to the markets of Constantinople, allowing them to 
pass by the middlemen of the Khazar and Volga­Bulgar 
markets. The long journey from Birka or Staraya Ladoga 
over the rivers of the east European plains to the Black 
Sea and the lucrative markets of the Near East was a 
risky, but potentially high­profit undertaking. 
In this way fortified trading centres and  towns grew 
from often Slavic settlements along the great rivers in 
the course of the late ninth and early tenth centuries, 
forming the basis of the realm of Rus, with Kiev the seat 
of power from the end of the ninth century. Rus con­sisted of separate principalities that were ruled by an elite of mostly Scandinavian origin. They were all subject 
to the grand princes of Kiev, a dynasty that traced its de ­
scent to merchants and warriors from central Sweden. These market towns — the administrative and military 
centres of the constituting principalities — gave Kievan 
Rus its Old Norse name Garðaríki, ‘realm of the fortified 
towns’. They were the transfer hubs that also controlled 
the routes in a trade network reaching from Birka in 
Sweden to the Black and the Caspian Sea, from the Var ­
angians to the Greeks. The Nordic families that had set­tled in the towns of Garðaríki gradually assimilated into 
Slavic society over the tenth century. They adopted 
Slavic names and the use of the name Rus in the sources

"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY92changed from indicating Nordic descent to designating 
the inhabitants of the Kievan Rus territory. The new 
shared identity that developed in the Rus settlements 
rose over separate ethnic origins through a sense of 
belonging to a collective culture that was permeated 
with warrior ideology and in which Nordic, Slavic,  
Byzantine, and equestrian­nomadic influences amal­
gamated into a single new culture.
VARANGIANS IN CONSTANTINOPLE:  
BETWEEN THREAT AND BODYGUARD
The relationship between the young realm of Kievan Rus and the powerful Byzantine Empire was ambivalent. LONG-DISTANCE TRADE
This Arabian bronze vessel was 
found in a wealthy woman’s grave from the 10th century near Aska (Sweden). Below the neck is an  Arabic inscription. Together with other luxury items in the grave it shows the extent of the Vikings’ trade connections. Constantinople’s policy on Rus was shaped by political 
and military rather than economic interests; its aim was 
to integrate the new high­potential neighbours into 
Byzantine alliance politics, especially given the empire’s 
problematic position between a number of warlike  
peoples in the north (Khazars, Pechenegs, Magyars, and 
Volga Bulgars) and the Arab caliphate in the south­west. 
The Rus, on the other hand, were primarily interested in 
direct access to the Byzantine and Arab markets. Never ­
theless they repeatedly raided the Byzantine Black Sea coast and even attacked Constantinople itself, until sev ­
eral peace treaties were made between Byzantine emper ­
ors and Kievan grand princes in the mid­tenth century. 
The treaties included provisions on trade and under cer ­
tain conditions allowed Rus merchants access to the markets of Constantinople. The Byzantine emperor also 
granted the Rus warriors, named Varangians here, the 
right to enrol as mercenaries for the empire. This combi­
nation of trade and mercenary activities as well as col­
lecting tributes was as attractive as it was lucrative for the 
Rus and brought about the establishment of a warrior 
elite in Kievan Rus. The Nordic mercenaries’ military potential secured the throne for Basil II (sole emperor 
976–1025) in 988 and led to the formation of the Varan­
gian Guard, in which the future Norwegian king Harald 
Hardrada (r. 1046–1066) served for some time.
In exchange for the military support, Basil II gave the 
hand of his sister Anna Porphyrogenita (963–1011/12) to 
Vladimir the Great, grand prince of Kievan Rus (r. 980–
1015). For the wedding, Vladimir had himself baptised in 
988, which is seen as the beginning of the Christianisa­
tion of Kievan Rus — although Vladimir, just like Harald 
Bluetooth in Denmark two decades earlier, embraced the Christian faith for political reasons rather than out of 
personal conviction. By this time at the latest, the sphere 
of influence of a mostly Scandinavian elite controlling 
the trade routes from the Baltic to the Black Sea had de ­
veloped into a kingdom under Slavic influence that was an integral part of medieval Christian Europe. Although 
the political elite of Kievan Rus was highly Slavonised 
from the end of the tenth century, close political and 
family ties to the Scandinavian kingdoms persisted for a 
long time. Vladimir’s son Yaroslav the Wise (r. 1019–1054) in 1019 married the daughter of the Swedish king 
Olof Skötkonung (r. 995–1022), and in the eleventh cen­
tury several Norwegian kings in exile stayed at Yaroslav’s 
court in Novgorod (Russia). "

Over two dozen of the 2,000 rune -
stones round Lake Mälaren in east 
Sweden testify to the dramatic end of an expedition by Swedish Vikings to the Caspian Sea between 1036 and 104 1. Led by a certain Ingvar, it was one of the last Viking ex -
peditions we can trace historically.  The text marked clear red reads ‘han × entaþis + miþ : ikuari ×’:  ‘He ended/died with Ingvar.’FROM THE PAGAN VIKING AGE TO THE  
CHRISTIAN MIDDLE AGES
Like its beginning with the raid on Lindisfarne, the end 
of the Viking Age is often identified with a specific 
event. With the battle of Stamford Bridge (near York, 
England) on 25 September 1066, where the Anglo­Saxon 
king Harold Godwinson (r. January–October 1066) 
defeated the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada, the last 
claim of a Scandinavian ruler to the English throne was 
extinguished. This battle marked the end of an era of 
Viking rule and expansion. As it left the Anglo­Saxon 
army much weakened, it indirectly led to the conquest  
of England by the Normans (who also had Scandinavian 
origins) led by William the Conqueror (duke of Nor ­
mandy from 1035, king of England 1066–1087) at the Battle of Hastings in the same year. The mid­eleventh 
century also saw the dramatic failure of an expedition  
to the Caspian Sea by Vikings from central Sweden led 
by a certain Ingvar, which is known from numerous 
Swedish runestones, and the end of Viking expeditions 
to the east. 
The Christianisation of Scandinavia and the birth of  
the medieval Christian kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, 
Norway and Kievan Rus from the late tenth century onward constituted an incisive transformation of Vi ­
king­ Age society. With the establishment of bishoprics 
and the building of an ecclesiastical administrative struc­
ture Scandinavia had become a part of Christian Euro­
pean civilisation; the new Christian kingdoms were inte­
grated into the political structure of the ruling European 
dynasties, often by ties of kinship as well as diplomatic 
relations. Christianity drove out the pagan culture of the 
Viking Age; Scandinavian kings such as the Norwegian 
Sigurd the Crusader (r. 1103–1130) took part in the cru­
sades. The marauding pagan Viking chiefs had become 
Christian European kings.

Fadlan wrote about the journey — dur -

entitled Risala (Arabic ‘letter’, ‘report’).The mission was occasioned by a re  -
quest from Khan Almish ibn Yiltawar (r. AD 895–925), who had converted to Islam with his court and asked the 
caliph of Baghdad for instruction in 
Islamic precepts and for help in build -
ing a mosque. The khan’s conversion undoubtedly had something to do with 
the possibility of a political alliance 
with the powerful caliphate against the neighbouring Khazars, an equestrian people that had converted to Judaism 
and to which the Volga Bulgars owed 
tribute.  In the summer of 921the embassy 
started on the Silk Road and first made 
for Bukhara (Uzbekistan), then the  
capital of the Samanid Empire, where 
they made unsuccessful attempts to 
exact the tribute the khan had been 
promised as financial support. From Bukhara they sailed down the Oxus 
(now the Amudarya) to Jurjaniya  
(Gurganj, now Kunya-Urgench) in  
the province of Chorasmia/Khorezm 
south of the Aral Sea. As the cold set in, 
the embassy had to spend the winter 
there, and many participants preferred returning to Baghdad. The next spring 
they continued their journey to Bolghar 
through the territories of the Oghuz 
Turks and the Pechenegs (Kazakhstan) 
along the Caspian Sea. In May 922 the 
embassy reached Bolghar. Ibn Fadlan

toms and the Volga Bulgars’ attempts  to stick to the Islamic precepts, which IN BUKHARA
The Ark of Bukhara is a massive fortress in 
the city of Bukhara, Uzbekistan, and was built in the 5th century AD. Ibn Fadlan must have visited this complex during his stay in Bukhara, since the fortress not only served as a military structure but also encompassed the royal court. The Ark was used as a for -
tress until it fell to Russia in 1 920. At present the Ark is a tourist attraction and houses  museums covering its history.

"were new to them. When it turned out 
that he could not give Khan Almish the 
promised financial support, his mission 
hung by a thread — but although the 
khan felt that Ibn Fadlan had deceived him, a friendly understanding between 
the two men developed that was 
marked by exchanges of puns over the missing financial support, with Almish 
calling Ibn Fadlan ‘Abu Bakr the Truth -
ful’, a reference to the seventh-century caliph who allegedly was unable to lie.
In Bolghar the Arab diplomat first met 
the Rus, who used its market as a trans-
fer hub for trade with the Orient. Much 
impressed by their looks, he wrote that 
he had never seen more perfect bodies and that they were tall as palm trees. 
He described in detail how they looked, 
their clothes and weapons, the women’s 
jewellery and their religious beliefs. But 
he was appalled by their customs and 
particularly by their lack of personal 
hygiene, calling them ‘the filthiest of God’s creatures’ and ‘like wandering 
donkeys’. The Rus’ liberated sexual 
behaviour, which he mentions repeat -
edly, appears to have annoyed him greatly. Ibn Fadlan’s powerful eyewitness re  -
port of a Rus funeral in Bolghar is 
unique. Some of the rites he describes 
are otherwise unknown, but the funeral 
type — cremation on a ship and human 
and animal sacrifice — corresponds to 
Viking funeral rites known from finds in 
Scandinavia. Discrepancies between his report and other historical or ar  -
chaeological sources on Vikings and Rus may stem from the fact that the  
Rus he met had already adopted cer -
tain elements of other cultures. Ibn Fadlan’s travelogue is considered  
a trustworthy and valuable source on 
the steppe peoples’ pre-Islamic culture 
and on ancient Russian history. His astute and objective observations con -
tain a wealth of information on the cul -
tures he encountered on his journey of 
over 2,800 miles; on the culture of the 
Oghuz Turks for instance, who later 
founded the Ottoman Empire. The  
Risala also reveals the character of its author: curious about foreign peoples, 
educated and with a sense of humour. 
Ibn Fadlan bore the hardships of his 
mission with equanimity, complaining 
only once of the cold freezing his beard 
solid. Unfortunately we know nothing 
more about him, not even the years of 
his birth and death or his profession at 
the caliph’s court. Nor do we know what happened after the events described in

FRANKS AND MEROVINGIANS
Written sources mention the Franks for the first time  
in the second half of the third century during the first 
Germanic migrations across the Rhine into the Roman 
Empire. At that time the Franks are not a clearly defined 
nation, but rather a federation of several Germanic peo­
ples (Chamavi, Chattuarii, Bructeri, Ampsivarii, and Sa ­
lians), originally from the region between Rhine and Weser. New migrations of these so­called Barbarians in 
the next century led to the integration of the Franks into 
the empire as laeti or foederati. They offered military  
service and received in return the possibility to climb  
up to the highest ranks of the imperial army. In this way 
the Frankish leaders established small kingdoms. Certain 
kings and high Roman officers are mentioned as Mero­
vin  gians, a Salian dynasty whose initial territory lay 
mostly in today’s Belgium. Clovis I (r. AD 481/482–511) belonged to this important early ­medieval dynasty. He 
took over the rule of Gaul from the Romans and brought together all other independent Frankish realms, thus 
creating a unified Frankish kingdom. Clovis and his suc­
cessors brought the areas of the Thuringians, the Ale­
manni and the Burgundians under Frankish rule. In the second half of the sixth century, the Frankish realm 
reached from the Atlantic Ocean to the rivers Elbe and 
Saale, from the Channel to the Mediterranean, and as 
such bordered on the Byzantine Empire and the Saxon, 
Longobard, Slav, Anglo­Saxon, and Scandinavian territo­
ries. The exchange and mobility of people, traditions and 
materials — merchandise, plunder or gifts — between these regions is reflected by the written sources as  
well as the archaeological finds. 
THE FRANKS IN ARCHAEOLOGY
The archaeological sites and traces in the Frankish king­
dom consist of settlements, churches, monasteries, 
hoards, and above all burial sites, which serve as a pri­
mary source of knowledge on the Early Middle Ages. 
The number of excavated sites goes into the thousands. 
Important craft and trade centres have been investigated

"97 THE FRANKISH KINGDOM: HUB OF WESTERN EUROPE(Belgium), and Cologne (Germany). The Frankish settle­
ments differ substantially from the typical Roman stone 
architecture. They consist mostly of farmsteads with one 
or more large rectangular post buildings associated with 
smaller annex buildings, silos, wells and pits. The build­
ings were made of perishable materials such as wood or 
wattle and daub. The usually rectangular plots are delim­
ited by hedges, ditches and fences. The size of the settle­
ments varies from single­family farms to extended fam­
ily groups. Although recent excavations have brought  
to light numerous new settlement sites, they are still 
outnumbered by the burial sites. On the other hand, ex ­
isting settlements founded by the Romans did not disap­pear completely. They show a continuity during the 
early ­medieval period, as documented for example in 
the cities of Tournai, Trier, Paris and Cologne. Neverthe­less, a breach in construction methods can be attested.
 
THE CONQUESTS OF CLOVIS I
This map shows the conquests of 
Clovis I (r. 481/482–5 1 1), who united the Frankish kingdoms un -
der his rule and conquered large parts of Roman Gaul. Clovis be -
longed to the Merovingian dynasty, which was to rule the Frankish king -
dom for the next two centuries.FRANKISH BURIALS AND WHAT WE CAN  
GLEAN FROM THEM
Local and regional differences are clearly observed in 
burial grounds that show a continuity between Late 
Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. The extensive 
ones, however, often covering the whole Merovingian 
period, are uniformly categorised under the name of 
row ­grave fields (Reihengräberfelder). They emerge in  
a wider Roman­Germanic contact zone that is not re ­
stricted to the Frankish area. From the end of the fifth 
century they are characterised by typical burial practices 
and the inclusion of grave goods such as weapons and 
jewellery. Specific tomb forms, particularly chamber 
tombs and long, narrow grave­pits, are archaeologically 
documented, as are the development, production and 
distribution of specific finds. The more or less regular 
equipment in the graves indicates the military and  
hierarchical status of the deceased in society. It includes 
bi  conical pots and different types of bow and disc fibu­
lae, and especially, for male burials, the addition of weapons: angons (javelins), battle axes and franciscae 
(throwing axes), spear heads, spathae and other swords, 
and above all seax (small swords). 
DRESS, ACCESSORIES AND WEAPONS
Given the absence of iconographical sources, it is princi­
pally the archaeological data that enable us to catch a 
glimpse of the Merovingian costume. They give hints  
of a Late Antique dress code adapted under Germanic 
influence. Metal brooches, buckles and fittings are often 
the only part of the clothing still present in the graves.  
Concerning women’s costume it is thought that the use 
of brooches was common, even beyond the Frankish  
territory, while specific dress accessories such as orna­
mental discs and belt buckles varied between the west­
ern and eastern parts of the territory. In the beginning of

and waist. During the second half of the sixth century, 
fashion changed under Mediterranean influence. From 
that period, women closed their cloaks with a single big­
ger brooch at the neck.
Male graves with particularly precious weapons such as 
the gold­hilt spatha (late fifth and early sixth century)  
or the sixth­century ring swords are associated with 
high officials in the service of the Frankish king. Buckles 
and fittings were mostly made of iron or copper alloy; 
silver and gold are rare. Their shape, size and ornaments 
changed from one generation to the other. From narrow 
copper ­alloy or garnet­inlay buckles with or without fit­
tings in the fifth and early sixth century they evolved into broad damascened iron buckles and fittings in the 
seventh century. Helmets were only used by Frankish 
army commanders. Spangenhelme (the Spangen being 
the metal strips framing the helmet, see p. 100) such  
as the one buried with the ‘Master of Morken’ were  
manufactured for the Byzantine army and could only  
be obtained by personal relations. 
FUSION OF DECORATIVE STYLES
The Frankish arts and crafts combine the interlaced 
ornaments of Late Antiquity with the Germanic ani mal­
style decoration, testifying to the extraordinary dynam­ics of fusion of diverse cultural influences and traditions. In addition to the cloisonné technique, the so­called  
animal style — adopting and actively transforming Ro ­
man pictorial elements, e.g. on military belts in the Ger ­
manic world — is characteristic of this period. The so­
called Animal Style I, primarily known from Scandinavia and England, shows single, anatomically clearly distinct 
animals. In the course of the sixth century it evolves into 
the so­called Animal Style II, in which the individual 
animals are intertwined to the point of being indistin­
guishable. 
ROMAN INFLUENCE
It appears from written sources that elements of Roman 
state organisation under Frankish rule were adopted to a 
certain degree only, which varied strongly from region 
to region. This concerns judicial and fiscal regulations, in 
which we can distinguish between German and Roman 
or Gallo­Roman populations. Thus the Franks adopted 
the ecclesiastical organisation developed in the Late Ro ­
man period as a basis for their administration, and the Latin language as political language. This enabled the 
governability and the stability of the great Frankish 
realm, which comprised many different populations and 
languages. A continued Late Antique influence on popu­
lation groups in the Frankish kingdom can be proven by, 
among other things, linguistic evidence in Latin funerary 
inscriptions. The Roman economic order, based on a 
monetary economy and supply through large es   tates, 
hardly found any continuation in the Frankish kingdom, 
while Roman infrastructure, with its central stone build­
ings as administrative centres, isolated fortifications, 
episcopal sees and cult buildings, together with the 
ecclesiastical structures, remained in use to a varying 
extent. The latter was made possible by Clovis I, who was baptised in Reims around AD 500. Material culture 
also documents a continued existence of Late Antique 
customs (the use of gravestones, for example), fashion 
and technologies. Particularly the upper class adopted 
aspects of the lifestyle of population groups marked by 
Late Antiquity. This is documented by means of their 
burial goods, such as bronze and ceramic bowls used for 
washing hands before a feast. 
TRADE AND OTHER CONTACTS
The survival of trade routes and commercial contacts is 
proved by written sources as well as grave goods. Apart 
from coins, individual jewellery and raw materials such SOUTH-ASIAN BEADS 
Necklace (AD 475–530) with

manic influences, illustrate the transition between Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages and prove that so-called laeti or foederati (Franks serving in the Roman army) lived in this region.as shell disks and amethysts from the Mediterranean 
area or garnets and beads from southern Asia, precious 
textiles were traded as well. Chinese silk reached the 
Frankish area via the Byzantine Empire. A wide distri bu­
tion of shell disks, amethysts and garnets, even of lesser quality and in graves not necessarily belonging to the 
upper class, demonstrates that some categories of goods 
were not exclusively reserved to the social elite.
Direct personal contacts with the Mediterranean area,  
in particular with the Byzantine Empire, are also docu­
mented by written sources and archaeological finds alike. 
This resulted in the transfer of prestige goods, dress or  ­
naments and military equipment from the Byzantine 
army such as helmets, armour or special types of spear ­
heads. The exchange of goods, gifts or money was fur ­
thermore favoured by diplomatic contacts between  
the Franks and the Byzantine Empire (e.g. an alliance at 
the beginning of the Gothic War in AD 535, a peace 
treaty in 571, and an alliance against the Longobards in 
578), the Ostrogoths and the Longobards, but also by 
multiple invasions of Frankish armies in northern Italy 
during the sixth century. Literary sources tell us about the mobility of men, especially merchants, ambassadors 
and pilgrims, warriors and kings, but also of women, on 
the basis of marriage ties. Various connections between 
the Frankish royal house and the Thuringian, Longo­
bard, Gothic or Anglo­Saxon territories are documented. 
Connections with Thuringia and Saxony for example, 
before and after the integration of the Thuringian terri­tory into the Frankish realm, are associated with a vivid exchange of goods and funerary customs along old trade 
routes such as the Westphalian Hellweg. 
The archaeological sources also reveal close connections 
with the Anglo­Saxon region and what is now Scandina­
via.
 Examples are the typical continental brooches and 
parts of pendants found in women’s graves, or the thir­
ty­seven Merovingian gold coins in Mound 1 of Sutton 
Hoo (Suffolk, England). During the seventh century, settlements, harbours and trading centres at the North 
Sea seemed to become more important than the Medi­
terranean connections. Next to Dorestad, taken over  
by the Franks from the Frisians in the seventh century, 
Quentovic by the end of the seventh century became  
the most important trade hub and port of the Franks in 
northern France. Both towns connected the Frankish 
kingdom with the Anglo­Saxon ports, but also with the 
west coast of Jutland (Denmark), where Frankish glass "

be coincidental. Limestone, h. 52 cm, found at Königswinter-Nieder -

From the second half of the sixth century, vassalage in 
the Frankish realm strongly influenced the perception of 
social status and symbols, archaeologically recognisable 
by the discovery of ceremonial swords in the northern 
areas. Close connections are thus noticed between the 
equipment of Nordic warriors, especially from Gotland 
(Sweden) and Bornholm, and those of the continent.  
On the other hand, in the area of the Frankish realm, 
mostly in former Alemannic territory, find groups such 
as gold bracteates (medallions) and bow brooches with 
rectangular head plates, highly decorated feet and runic 
inscriptions are encountered. They find their models  
and origin in the Anglo­Saxon area and Scandinavia and 
indicate a common symbolism. 
LATER DEVELOPMENTS
In later times as well, when Charlemagne and his succes­sors from the Carolingian dynasty established Frankish 
reign throughout western Europe, great efforts were 
made to attain the imperial dignity of Rome, building remains have been found. Numerous settlements in  Jutland, Zealand and Bornholm (Denmark), Scania and 
Halland (Sweden) reveal that they were integrated into 
an interregional network of contacts, in particular with the Frankish kingdom, despite the religious differences 
between the expanding Christianity under Frankish rule 
and the pagan population of what is now Scandinavia. MORKEN HELMET
This magnificent Spangenhelm

The helmet is decorated with a band depicting birds picking at vines; in the centre, over the nose guard, is a man’s head flanked by lions. This refer -

"101 THE FRANKISH KINGDOM: HUB OF WESTERN EUROPEMEROVINGIAN BAPTISTERY
As a result of the unification of the 
Frankish kingdom under Clovis I and his successors many churches were built, especially monastery churches. Plans often continued the Roman basilica tradition, but also incorporated influences from as far away as Syria and Armenia. The Baptistère Saint-Jean (Baptis-tery of St John) in Poitiers (France) was built c.360 on top of Roman structures, badly damaged during the Visigoth occupation in the  5th century, and restored under Clovis. Despite the centuries of demolitions, additions and other changes, the baptistery is one of the most prominent examples of Merovingian architecture.

At the same time, the personal contacts between the  
Frankish elites and the rest of northern Europe influ­enced, together with the magnificent buildings of the 
Frankish nobles, the development of society, especially 
in Scandinavia, and led to the Christianisation of that 
region. "
"When the Roman soldier Martinus, 
eighteen years old, gave half of his 
cloak to a beggar near Ambianum  
(now Amiens, France), he had already 
travelled half the Roman Empire. Mar -
tin (AD 336?–397) was born the son of a soldier in Sabaria (Szombathely in 
western Hungary, near the Austrian border), spent part of his youth in  
Ticinum (Pavia, Italy), and during his 
military service went to Gaul via  
Mediolanum (Milan) and Augusta  
Vangionum (Worms, Germany).
It seems ironic that precisely the halved 
cloak that was to make St Martin one  
of Europe’s most popular saints was  
suppressed almost completely by his hagiographer (author of a saint’s bi  -
ography), his younger contemporary Sulpicius Severus (c.363–c.425).  
What was the problem? Although his 
encounter with the beggar and the 
vision of Jesus Christ that followed it 
had convinced Martin to have himself baptised and devote his life to serving 
the Church, pacifism was an important 
part of Christian doctrine at the time 
and the idea that any soldier would 
devote himself to the Church was hard 
to stomach. Which was precisely what 
had happened: after his baptism, Mar -
tin remained in the Roman army for at least two years before he could have himself dismissed after meeting the Caesar Julian in 356 and saying: ‘I am 
no longer the caesar’s soldier, I am a 
soldier of Christ.’Late Roman Gaul in the fourth century 
was a land in chaos where the Germans 
had already invaded once; Sulpicius’ 
hagiography was meant as an example 
for the conversion of the pagan rural 
population, which made it advisable to 
downplay the fact that Martin was a  
soldier. The St-Martin cult featuring  
the halved cloak did not develop until  TRAVELLER

Christianity and pacifism had parted

back then, for that was how people imagined a soldier at the time. His 
famous cloak (cappa  in Latin) became 
part of the treasure of the Merovingian kings, who took the relic with them on their travels. On the way it was kept in 
sanctuaries, allegedly giving rise to  
the word ‘chapel’ (from cappella , ‘little 
cloak’). Upon his dismissal from the army in 
356 Martin went back home to convert 
his parents (having success with his 
mother in any case, according to Sul -
picius) and subsequently went into retreat for a few years on the island of 
Gallinara off the Ligurian coast (north-west Italy). Having been appointed ex  -
orcist by Bishop Hilary of Poitiers, Mar -
tin founded Gaul’s first monastery 
there to live there as a monk. He alleg -
edly worked some miracles, resurrect -
ing two of his followers who had died 
and thereby establishing his reputation as a healer. An appeal to his healing 
skills was the ruse with which the citi -
zens of Tours lured him out of the mon -
astery in 371 to elect him bishop de  -
spite his protests. Near Tours, Martin founded another monastery: Marmou -
tier, on the far bank of the Loire. He was to hold the double office of bishop and 
abbot for the rest of his life, but in fact preferred working in solitude. 
Sulpicius’ hagiography was criticised  
by his contemporaries, the monks of 
Marmoutier among them. It was said 
that many miracles he attributed to St 
Martin were either fabricated or copied 
from other saints’ lives. These included the story of a pagan sanctuary that was 
destroyed by a storm following a prayer 
by St Martin; snakes, birds and dogs 
slinking off on his command; an evil 
heathen who attacked the holy man 
with his sword and just fell on his back; 
a leper who recovered after a kiss from St Martin; paralysed or deaf and dumb 
girls who were healed with an oil treat -
ment and prayer; a young servant who had hanged himself and was revived  
by the saint’s touch — not to mention the 
numerous exorcisms and encounters with angels that Sulpicius enumerates. 
Despite the accusation of fabricated miracles, St Martin became a highly 
popular saint and one of the first ‘con -
fessors of the faith’: Christians who were canonised for the way they lived, not  for their martyrdom. St Martin was the 
most important saint in the Merovin -
gian and Carolingian monarchies. His half of the famous cloak followed the 
kings wherever they went, proving an 
irresistible relic in the liturgy as well as 
a powerful talisman in battle.

"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY104THE SLAVS  
BETWEEN THE 
FRANKS AND  
THE BYZANTINES
Raymond Detrez
The first reports on Slavs in Europe are found in sixth­
century Byzantine sources. Jordanes (? – after AD 552)  
in The Origins and Deeds of the Goths mentions three 
Slavic peoples: the Veneti, the Slavs, whom he calls 
Sclaveni, and the Antes, each comprising several tribes. 
Traditionally, it is assumed on the basis of scarce and 
questioned archaeological and linguistic data that the 
Slavs arrived in Europe from central Asia in the eighth 
century BC and settled in a large area centred on the net­
work of rivers around the present­day Pripet Marshes 
(south Belarus and north Ukraine). From there, part of 
the Slavs moved west and south in the sixth and seventh 
centuries AD. Other Slav groups moved north, where 
they drove out or assimilated Fins and Balts.
Recently Florin Curta argued that, since migration is a 
more or less organised and massive movement of popu­
lations, the Slavs, who represented an ethnically unde­
fined mass, never really ‘migrated’, but widely spread as a 
result of the ‘itinerant form of agriculture’ they practised. 
A Slav ethnic identity and consciousness emerged in the 
sixth century as a result of contacts with the Byz antines. 
According to Curta, the archaeological artefacts found in 
Central Europe cannot be attributed to the Slavs, as they 
represent social rather than ethnic markers.
The origin of the name ‘Slav’ (Church Slavonic slove ˇnin; 
Belarussian, Bulgarian, Russian slavyanin; Bosnian, Cro­
atian slavenin; Polish słowianin; Serbian slovenin; Slovak, 
Slovenian, Czech slovanin; Ukrainian slovyanin) is often linked to the Slav word slava, ‘glory’, or slovo, ‘word’. A 
more plausible etymology connects slav­ or slov­ with the Indo­European verbal root *k ˆleu­, meaning ‘irrigate’, 
‘wash’ (compare Latin cloaca, Greek klysma). The suffix ­e ˇnin, ­enin, ­(y)anin means ‘inhabitant of’. Conse­
quently a sla/ovyanin would be an inhabitant of a coun­
try rich in water, which would suit the Pripet Marshes  
(if they were the Slavs’ original settlement area). 
On the steppe north of the Black Sea, from the sixth  
century BC to the second century AD the people that 
from a linguistic point of view we could call Slavs lived 
in close contact with the Scythians and the Sarmatians, two equestrian peoples from Iran who constituted the 
dominant class. The so­called Slavic­Iranian symbio­
sis — the Iranian cultural influence on these Slavs,  
allegedly discernible in a number of common semantic developments in Iranian and Slavic — may have led to 
Zoro  astrian influence on Slavic religious beliefs. Modern 
Serbs and Croats still have names of Iranian origin, 
which probably hark back to the time when their ances­
tors lived in Scythia. To the present day a small Slavic  
people called the Sorbs lives in south­east Germany, 
near the Polish­Czech border, in the place the Byzantine 
emperor ­historiographer Constantine VII (r. 913–959)  
in his The Administration of the Empire calls ‘White  Serbia’. There was a White Croatia as well; both were 
central­European stops on the Serbs’ and Croats’ way 
from Scythia to the Byzantine provinces in the western 
Balkans. 
From the second to the fourth century AD the afore­
mentioned Slavs lived under the dominion of the Ger ­
manic Goths, who controlled the whole region from  the Baltic to the Black Sea. They copied elements of pol­itical, military and economic affairs from the Goths, 
together with the relevant Germanic terminology: plugu ˇ 
(plough), šlemu ˇ (helmet), kupiti (buy), kusiti (choose),  
to name but a few. Whether as migrants, as itinerant 
farmers or assimilating other groups, Slavs spread west­
ward up to the imaginary line connecting the modern 
cities of Hamburg and Venice. Over the following centu­
ries the line of their expansion moved back east, approxi­
mately to the western border of the present­day Slavic 
states in central Europe, as a result of Frankish expan­
sion. The Slavs were driven out or assimilated. The same 
happened in the Balkans, where the Slavs moved in up 
to the Peloponnesus in the seventh century and overran 
the autochthonous Greek, Thracian and Illyrian popula­
tion; over the following centuries, also as a result of the 
Byzantines transferring Greeks from Asia Minor to the 
Balkans, they were Hellenised. The broad transition "

zone between Slavs and Greeks stabilised in Macedonia 
and Thrace by the tenth century. 
From the sixth to the late eighth century the Slavs in 
central Europe lived under the dominion of another no ­
madic steppe people, the Avars. The latter made raids into Frankish and Byzantine territory in which Slavs 
were involved as well. In 623 Samo (?–658), a Frankish 
merchant from the vicinity of modern Paris who pro b­ably led the armed escorts of trade caravans, led a Slavic rebellion against the Avars. ‘An astonishing number of 
Avars was slaughtered,’ Fredegar writes in his chronicle 
on the Merovingian king Dagobert I (r. 629­639). ‘The 
Slavs, recognising Samo’s merit, made him their king 
and he ruled them for thirty ­five years.’ ‘Samo’s King­
dom’ possibly included what is now the Czech Republic, Moravia, and parts of Austria and Slovenia. Samo also 
made his own raids on Frankish territory; in 630 he de ­
feated Dagobert’s army. Although according to Fredegar he had twenty ­two sons and fifteen daughters by twelve 
Slavic women, none of his offspring was able to con­tinue his work. After Samo’s death in 658 nothing more 
is heard of his kingdom, but it may have lived on in Great 
Moravia, which came about in the ninth century and 
comprised approximately the same area. 
‘Samo’s Kingdom’ is the oldest known Slavic state.  
Like other early Slavic states, it owed its existence to a 
non­Slavic initiative. The Slavs, living in tribes, appar ­
ently were not yet disposed to create their own states. The Bulgars, who settled in the north­east Balkans in  
the 660s and coexisted with the Slavic tribes that had arrived a few decades earlier, were a Turkic­speaking 
tribe from central Asia. In 681 the Byzantine Empire 
implicitly recognised the existence of a Bulgar state by 
agreeing after a conflict to pay an annual tribute. The "
"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY106Turkic Bulgars had a dominant position and the Slavs 
under their rule started to call themselves Bulgars as 
well. The Turkic Bulgars, however, were gradually as ­
similated by the Slavic majority. Modern Bulgarian, which is a Slavic language, retains only a few Bulgar ­ 
Turkic words. Thus Bulgaria became a Slavic state in  the ninth century. In exactly the same way the dominant 
Germanic Franks adopted the Gallo­Romans’ Romance 
language, while the Gallo­Romans started to call them­
selves French (Franks), and their country France.SAINTS CYRIL AND METHODIUS

"107 THE SLAVS: BETWEEN THE FRANKS AND THE BYZANTINESThe newly arrived Slavs in central and south­east Europe 
faced two powerful states: the Frankish Kingdom and 
the Byzantine Empire respectively. The Franks had prof­
ited greatly from the Roman state traditions that the 
Church had kept alive; the Byzantine Empire was the 
continuation, mostly unscathed, of the Eastern Roman 
Empire. Confronted with these states, the Slavs could 
survive only by copying their administrative, military, 
economic and other abilities. Christianisation was the 
ticket to these abilities. Both superpowers were happy  
to send missionaries to Slav territory in order to expand their sphere of influence. The Slavs only had to take care 
that their conversion did not result in a loss of independ­
ence.
In the 860s the king of Great Moravia wished to take 
measures against the growing influence of the Frankish 
clergy in his country. He asked the Byzantine Emperor  
to send missionaries who could introduce a Slavonic  
liturgy in his country, to replace the Latin one. The Em ­
peror Michael III (r. 842–867) appointed two translators: the monks Cyril (827–869) and Methodius (c.820–885),

city: Thessaloniki in Macedonia. They developed a com­
plicated script called the Glagolitic alphabet (from Slav­
onic glagolu ˇ , ‘word’) and translated the main litur  gical 
texts into the Slavonic dialect of their native city, which 
at the time was understood perfectly well in Moravia. 
This language came to be known as Church Slavonic. 
Judging from their speedy delivery, the texts had prob­
ably already been translated in Constantinople: compet­
ing with Rome to win over the Slavs in central and 
south­east Europe, Constantinople was eager to spread 
its influence through missionary activity. In any case, 
Cyril and Methodius introduced Slavonic liturgy in 
Great Moravia; but only a few years later, after a regime 
change that bolstered Frankish influence, the Latin rite 
once more replaced the Slavonic one. Like the Polish, 
who remained entirely outside the Byzantine sphere of 
influence, the Czechs and Slovaks would become part  
of Roman­Catholic Europe. The Slavonic liturgy was  
followed by all Orthodox Slavic nations.
Cyril’s and Methodius’ pupils were chased out of Great 
Moravia after the regime change. Some went to Bulgaria, 
which had been Christianised from Constantinople in the 860s and now followed the Greek liturgy. The Bulgar 
king Boris I (r. 853–889) welcomed them: to him, intro­
ducing the Slavonic rite was a way to limit Byzantine in ­fluence. The monasteries in the capital, Preslav, and in Ohrid in Macedonia turned into centres of mission work 
and literary activity; most texts were translated from  
the Greek, but original works in Church Slavonic were 
produced as well. The impractical Glagolitic script was  
gradually replaced by a Greek ­influenced one called the 
Cyrillic alphabet in honour of Cyril, who had nothing  to do with it. The Cyrillic alphabet is still used by the 
Orthodox Slavic peoples today.
In the course of the ninth century the first Russian state 
appeared, centred around Novgorod in the north and 
Kiev in the south. In this case the Rus, Vikings from 
Scandinavia, seem to have been the catalyst. Via the Rus­
sian rivers the Vikings conducted trade between the Bal­
tic region and Constantinople, involving the local Slavs 
on the way. Members of the Rurik dynasty shared the 
rule over the principalities that developed at the main 
traffic hubs and together constituted Rus. Once more,  
a foreign people gave the land and the people its name, 
but adopted the language of the Slav majority. 
Toward the end of the tenth century the Russian grand 
prince of Kiev, Vladimir the Great (r. 980–1015), decided to replace the worship of various clan deities in his coun­
try with a monotheistic religion, to suit the centralised 
and ethnically homogeneous monarchy he intended to "

the Patriarchate of Constantinople, while the language

By the end of the first millennium, most Slavic peoples 
had found their place in Europe. They founded states 
that were to last until today. Stimulated by nearby Con  ­
stantinople — which, unlike Rome, did not object to a 
liturgy in the vernacular — the Bulgars by creating a  
Slavonic script and written language had made the first important Slavic contribution to European culture. The 
West­Slavic peoples were soon fully integrated into the 
Catholic world and contributed to the development of 
western­European medieval and Renaissance culture. "

PERIOD IN THE 
CARPATHIAN BASIN
Zsófia Rácz and Gergely Szenthe
The Avars, equestrian nomads from the steppes, are first 
mentioned in Byzantine sources in AD 557. The first 
Avar ruler (khagan) we know of, Bajan, in 567 en  tered 
into an alliance with the Pannonian Longobards (see Schmauder’s contribution), who were under threat  
from Gepidic and Byzantine armies. Not long after their 
united victory — at Easter 568 — the Longobards left 
Pannonia for Italy. Subsequently the Avars took control of the entire Carpathian Basin (modern Hungary and 
parts of the surrounding countries) and became the first 
to unite it under one political entity for a long duration. 
During the first period of its 250­year existence, the Avar 
Khaganate conducted an extraordinarily vigorous for ­
eign strategy. Bajan’s forces penetrated the Byzantine Empire’s northern line of defence and sacked the for ­
tresses along the border (limes) of the Lower Danube. Through the year 626, the Avars launched a succession 
of military campaigns on the Balkan Peninsula, forcing 
Constantinople to conclude a series of peace treaties  
that required the payment of an ever greater annual tax 
(tri butum) to the khaganate. At the height of the Avars’ 
power, the yearly sum was 120 thousand solidi — gold coins issued by the Byzantine Empire (one solidus 
weighed 4.54 gr) — which was supplemented with vari­
ous gifts. By 630, the Avar Khaganate’s power was wan­ing. In 626, allied with the Sassanid Persians, the Avars 
failed to seize Constantinople. Around the same time, 
following an uprising by the Kuban Bulgars (the Kuban 
is a river in southern Russia), they also lost their lands east of the Carpathians and north of the Black Sea: the 
Avar Khaganate became a regional power restricted to 
the Carpathian Basin. The Avars were again relatively 
active in foreign affairs in the last third of the seventh 
century. The written sources report a military undertak ­
ing in Italy (670) and describe military campaigns to the west around 680, including the occupation of Lauriacum 
(today Lorsch, Germany). 
AVAR CULTURE AND SOCIETY
The early Avar realm was a diverse, culturally complex 
body. The ethnic groups arriving in the Carpathian Basin 
from the east were fleeing the advancing Turks and most 
likely originated from what is now Inner and Central 
Asia. The sources mention a variety of other eastern Eu ­
ropean peoples of the steppe region in connection with the Avars: not even Byzantine tradition considered the DISC FIBULA

shaped pendants, and so-called stylus pins for hair and clothing  discovered in Hungary preserve features of Late Antique Christian culture and Late Roman attire. We do not know whether the wearers descended from the Romanised people who had remained after  Roman rule, surviving the con -
quests of the Huns and Germans, or from the Christian population captured and relocated by the  Avars. Gilt silver, diam. 5 cm, c.580–6 20, Keszthely-Fenék -

migrating Avars a single people. We also read about 
(Germanic) Gepids and — chiefly because of Avar mili­
tary forays into the Balkans — Slavic peoples living un ­
der Avar rule and serving as auxiliary forces.
Because of the Carpathian Basin’s extensive river system 
and favourable geographic features, it has always been a 
densely populated region. Its environment differs mark ­
edly from the dry lands of the steppe where the social, military and political systems of the equestrian nomads 
developed. Because in the Carpathian Basin the vegeta­tion was quick to grow and replenish itself, the practice of nomadic pastoralism (the search for fresh pastures) 
was unnecessary there. When the Avars arrived in a land 
inhabited by an agrarian population living in village­like 
or farm­like settlements, they were likely inspired to 
settle. We know of villages from the first half of the sev ­
enth century that were probably used by descendants of both the local people and the nomadic Avars.
HIERARCHY AND MILITARY
We know less about the structure and social order of the Avar state than we do about its people. The ruler of the 
Avars was the khagan, modelled on the contemporary 
Turkic example of a supreme lord mediating between 
Earth and Heaven. Until the eighth century, no other 
political ranks are mentioned, but during the Frankish 
military forays in the late eighth century the political 
body may have radically transformed. By then, other 
ranks clearly existing in addition to khagan were tudun, 
jugurrus and kapkan; these titles corresponded to posi­
tions with a range of duties in the various polities of the 
Eurasian steppe.
One key to the military successes of the Avars was their 
state­of­the­art equestrian equipment and weaponry. 
They brought to Europe the iron stirrup, which trans­
formed military tactics. At the end of the sixth century, 
the Byzantine ‘Pseudo­Maurice’ (a handbook of Byzan­
tine military strategy) spoke of establishing and arming a 
cavalry following the Avar example. More importantly, 
the Avars incorporated the local population into their 
war ­oriented social system, which had its origins in the 
nomadic culture of the steppe. The local people were 
thus able to profit from the Avars’ military ventures.
MULTICULTURAL BURIAL FINDS
Striking proof of the mixed culture of the early Avar period is provided by the settlements and cemeteries 
excavated in central Hungary (Kölked, Szekszárd, Za ­
márdi). The dead in these large cemeteries, which con­tain as many as several thousand graves, belonged to 
communities of various ethnic origins: burials have been 
found of early nomadic migrants as well as Romanised 
and culturally Germanic people and their descendants. 
The grave goods reflect a network of connections that 
extended from northern Europe to the Byzantine Em ­
pire and Italy. Western, Italian, Avar and Byzantine ele­ments in the material culture of this population blended 
together. Its identity was shaped primarily by its mem­"

The Kunágota funeral assemblage 
is one of the very first Avar grave finds to have reached the Hungari -
an National Museum in 1 857 . This sword type with a ring pommel was part of the Avars’ Asiatic heritage. The golden mounts adorning the scabbard were cut from pressed sheets bearing figural scenes that originally decorated a Byzantine wooden object, perhaps a jewellery casket. The poor craftsmanship and the fragility of the mounts  suggest that the sword was made specially for the funeral as a cere -
monial weapon. The gold sheets are decorated with medallions portraying the companions of the Greek god Dionysus, with friezes showing the combat between a man and a lion and with a marine scene. Gold, mid-7th cent., Kunágota (Hungary).
bers’ participation in military campaigns and similar ac ­
tivities requiring mobility and flexibility, such as trade 
and mercenary service. 
The strong influence of Byzantine culture was manifest 
in the material culture of the Avars of the Carpathian 
Basin by the end of the seventh century. Intensive for ­
eign connections aided the Avars in acquiring not only the products of Byzantine elite workshops, but also the 
necessary technological ingenuity to produce them. 
Most of the precious metals found in graves are Byzan­
tine valuables — coins, jewellery, accessories and dishes. 
Additionally, some glassware, amphorae, bronze lamps, and iron chairs with silver inlays bear witness to the 
arrival of goods from the Mediterranean world. We can 
conclude from remnants of gold brocade found in burial 
sites that the Avars also had access to the most impor ­
tant luxury item of their time: silk made in Byzantine and Iranian workshops.Avar craftsmen copied objects made in the workshops of the Mediterranean world and created their own varia­
tions. The best proof of this is provided by the so­called 
goldsmith graves, in which press moulds for making 
prestige items, a variety of tools, and Byzantine scales 
and weights have been discovered. A portion of the pre­
cious metals acquired was melted down and used as a 
raw material; objects were cut up without any regard for 
the depictions adorning it. The culturally diverse groups 
of the Carpathian Basin, united under the Avar Khaga­nate, paint a rich and colourful picture of the Avar world. 
Avar grave goods from the second half of the seventh 
century, however, reveal fundamental changes that led 
to the emergence of a unified material and intellectual 
culture by the early eighth century (known as the Late 
Avar period). From an archaeological perspective, the 
most conspicuous changes were the expansion of the 
area of Avar settlements, an increase in the number of "
"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY114sites and finds, the transformation and increasing homo­
geneity of funerary rites and material culture, and the 
gradual disappearance of gold and silver objects from the 
graves. These changes are usually explained in Hungar ­
ian archaeology by the arrival of new people from the east, but in fact they were caused not as much by migra­
tion as by the integration of populations living alongside 
each other, as well as the settlement process and a gen­
eral change of circumstances in the Carpathian Basin and 
the surrounding area. Due to the Arab invasions in the 
second third of the seventh century, the Byzantine 
Empire now mainly consisted of modern Greece, Tur ­
key, and the Balkans. The end of the Early Byzantine period was characterised by the Muslim conquest, dwin­
dling trade, and the reduction of a web of connections 
spanning an entire continent to a smaller, regional net­
work. At this time, the processes leading to the forma­
tion of medieval Europe began: with the rise of new 
political powers, the area north of the Alps gained pro­minence as its economy and trade grew. The Carolingian 
state was the first to form, and its expansion eventually 
led to the fall of the Avar Khaganate.

In contrast to the graves of the seventh­century elite, 
which contained an abundance of expensive goods, the 
Late Avar graves, with their almost uniformly bronze 
objects, at first glance appear ‘impoverished’. The tens  GRIFFIN-AND-TENDRIL BELT SET

"115 THE AVAR PERIOD IN THE CARPATHIAN BASINof thousands of bronze finds, however, with their dis­
tinctive imagery and their high quality demonstrate that 
the culture of the Avars from the end of the seventh cen­
tury to the first half of the ninth was indeed a unique, 
independent phenomenon, but one that could not have 
formed in the absence of any ties to the world outside 
the Carpathian Basin.
The large­scale independence of the material culture of 
the Late Avar period becomes understandable not in 
terms of isolationism but rather within the context of 
contemporary world events. The Byzantine Empire’s 
strong influence began to diminish in response to politi­
cal, economic and social processes in the Mediterranean. 
In its place, regional, more independent material cul­
tures with weaker connections to external cultural and 
political centres gained importance in the Carpathian 
Basin as well. The strengthening of local elements and 
the thinning of the social stratum that had demanded 
luxury goods was manifest everywhere. Technical qual­
ity suffered the most: simple, primitive technologies,  
in particular the widely known craft of metal casting, 
gained ground as methods that required greater exper ­
tise receded.DECLINE OF THE AVARS
The long period of quiet and prosperity does not appear to have benefited the Avars, who had preserved ele­
ments of their nomad identity and shaped it into a uni­
fied Carpathian­Basin culture. At the end of the eighth 
century, the Avar Khaganate could no longer muster the 
political and military power necessary to confront the 
expanding Frankish state. In the late eighth century and 
the early years of the ninth, Charlemagne defeated the 
Avars. As a result of this invasion, the western region  
of the Carpathian basin became part of the Carolingian 
Empire, and subsequently a process of Christianisation 
commenced. The Avars are last mentioned in the record 
of the imperial council of Charlemagne held in Regens­
burg (south­east Germany) in 822, in a reference to their 
delegation. In the Frankish annals they are described as a 
subjugated people living in the eastern part of the 
empire or even farther east.
AMPHORA
The Byzantine Empire exported 
large quantities of oil and wine in amphorae, but only little reached the Carpathian Basin after the end of the Roman era. This amphora, which probably contained wine, was found in a 7th-century Avar grave in Hungary, so it must have been a prestigious luxury product there.

"118 CROSSROADS CONNECTIVITYINTRODUCTION
Lindsay Morehouse
The period between AD 300 and 1000 saw a social, reli -
gious, and cultural revolution of sorts that created a dynamic 
and complex world distinct from the Roman Empire that 
came before. The previous chapter outlined the rich diversity that was present in this period. There is an important thread, 
however, that runs through all the seemingly discrete groups: 
connectivity. It is clear from reading these chapters that each 
culture — at least to some extent — affected and was affected 
by another group. This chapter aims to demonstrate that, although the period produced distinctive groups of people, 
it equally produced an interconnected world.Much ancient and modern ink has been spilt outlining the 
violence and conflict that occurred between 300 and 1000; 
the Viking raids of Britain, the Goths’ invasions of Rome, and 
the Islamic conquest of Egypt are specific examples of the 
scenes that have defined the period in popular imaginations. 
These events did occur and without doubt had a significant 
impact on people, but the interactions between cultures at 
this time were not limited to those involving bloodshed. 
These years saw distinct local groups interacting, trading raw materials as well as luxury goods, exchanging ideas and 
beliefs, conflicting and negotiating peace with people from 
as far as the other side of the continent (and sometimes even 
farther).
We can see evidence of a ‘global’ early-medieval world 
through some of the smallest and most fragmented pieces of 
evidence: Frankish brooches were made with Byzantine gold; pilgrimage bottles from Egypt are found everywhere 
from Greece to Britain; Frankish smiths made bronze ves-
sels in the style of Egyptian pots; a Byzantine gold box was 
used to decorate an Avar chief’s sword.Connections between cultures also manifest in broader trends. Travel accounts from the medieval period provide 
snippets of the lives of pilgrims, tourists, scholars, and trad -
ers. One particularly evocative tale tells of a Byzantine diplo -
mat who visited the Huns with an Egyptian parrot that spoke fluent Greek. Even more broadly, changes in culture and 
society show us how different cultures were linked through 
daily life. The invocation of Classical Greek culture and 
Roman Imperial imagery in art shows a shared link to the 
past. The emergence of new religions such as Christianity and Islam connected people from different regions through 
a common faith, liturgy, doctrine, ritual and practices. Lux -
ury goods transported across continents shows an associa -
tion of people through trade. Knowledge and artistic styles 
from other cultures were adapted and appropriated. And, 
yes, war broke out between neighbours.  
These objects and texts stimulate the imagination and pro -
voke further questions. How did such small objects traverse 
such great distances? Why was there such a collective em  -
phasis on the Roman (and/or Classical Greek) past? What did people know and how did people learn? Why did war 
break out and how was it prevented? And, in such an inter -
connected and diverse world, how did people see themselves and express their identities? The following chapters will ex  -
plore connectivity in the early-medieval world both through small pieces of evidence — objects and texts — and through 
larger phenomena that connected cultures on a broader 
scale.<< ARAB WORLD MAP

Helen SaradiThe Byzantine Empire sprang from the Roman Empire 
after the profound crisis of the third century AD. In 293 
this unprecedented political, military, economic and  
cultural crisis led to the division of the Roman Empire 
by the Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) with two emper -
ors and two caesars. It was hoped that the empire would be better governed and defended. This division created 
four new capitals, excluding Rome. From the civil wars 
that broke out among the emperors and caesars, Flavius 
Valerius Aurelius Constantinus emerged as the victor in 
the West after defeating Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge 
near Rome (AD 312). Constantine ruled from 306 to 337. 
In 324, after defeating his rival Licinius, he became the 
sole emperor. The empire was united under Constan-

It was reunited for a short time in 350 and 392 and was 
finally divided in 395. 
Constantine made a fundamental change in the Roman 
Empire by ceasing persecutions of Christians. They were 
accorded privileges, such as tax exemptions for clergy 
and power of jurisdiction for bishops, and churches were 
built. As Constantine was the first Roman Emperor to  
be converted to the Christian religion, the Church pro-
claimed him a saint. According to the tradition his Chris-
tian mother, Helena, discovered the Holy Cross in Pales-
tine and built the Church of the Ascension on the site 
and that of the Nativity in Bethlehem. Constantine set  
a precedent when he intervened in Church disputes and 
theological controversies. In 325, following the Roman 
idea of pontifex maximus (the head of state as high 
priest), he participated in the first Church Council in 
Nicaea (modern Iznik, Turkey). In the future the Byzan-
tine emperors would be involved in ecclesiastical mat-
ters, theological controversies, the convening of ecu-
menical councils, and sometimes the promulgation of 
decrees on theological issues.On 18 September 324, Constantine defeated his co-em-

of the Bosporus. Then he decided to build his new capi-
tal in commemoration of his victory on the site of the 
ancient Greek city of Byzantium, located there. It was a 
major strategic point, connecting Europe with Asia and 
the Aegean with the Black Sea. According to a tradition 
recorded in the following century, Constantine had ini-
tially chosen the site of Troy on the Asian coast, but a 
divine vision made him change his mind. The city took 
his name, Constantinople (modern Istanbul, Turkey),  
in accordance with the tradition of ancient kings and 
Roman emperors to name the cities they founded after 
themselves. The legend of Constantine’s choice for Troy 
as a new capital implied a political message, suggesting 
that Constantine wanted to project his rule as a continu-
ation of Roman rule and his empire as successor of the 
Roman Empire by bringing the seat of his government to 
Troy: according to Roman tradition the mythical ances-
tor of the Romans, Aeneas, departed from Troy to settle 
in Latium.
Constantinople was dedicated on 11 May 330. To turn it 
into his new capital, Constantine remodelled the city of 
Byzantium with numerous elements of ancient Rome. Institutions and buildings matched those of Rome. He

This rectangular plaque shows a  
triumphant emperor: a crowned 
rider wearing a cuirass and holding a spear in his right hand, its point to the ground. Below the horse, a seat -
ed female figure holding a basket with fruits touches the emperor’s right foot in a gesture of submis-sion. On his left a winged Victory bears a palm frond, while on his right another figure can be seen. The scene is identical to the central plaque of the famous Barberini  Ivory, dated to the first half of the 6th century and kept in the Louvre. This enables us to identify the two secondary figures: they must be Terra (Earth) and a Persian or Scythian enemy. The plaque most probably refers  to the peace treaty known as the Perpetual or Eternal Peace, signed between the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Persia in AD 532. The  emperor can therefore be identi -
fied as Justinian (r. 527–565).The iconography of the victorious military leader was common on plaques, medallions and other  artefacts from the 4th to the 1 4th century, and stems from the typical adventus  motif on Roman coinage. 
The bronze plaque does not bear any sign indicating its weight, but the fact that it corresponds to the three-ounce weights of Late Antiq- uity (equalling a quarter of  a litra or libra, the main weight  unit for Romans and Byzantines), may indicate its use as an imperial weight. In that case the image of the emperor evokes his authority over weights and measures as  the guarantor of fair transactions. Plaque (or weight?), bronze, h. 4. 9 cm, 78. 9 gr, 6th cent. AD."

and was adorned with ancient statuary. There he erected 
his statue on a porphyry column. A later tradition made 
it a symbol of Constantinople, connecting it with Ro -
man and Christian relics allegedly deposited there: the 
palladium from Rome (the statuette of Athena that 
Aeneas took from Troy) and the nails of Christ’s crucifix-
ion. Constantine reconstructed the Church of Saint Irene 
(Peace) as the cathedral and built two churches dedicated 
to local martyrs. He built his own mausoleum, next to 
which was later built the Church of the Holy Apostles. 
The Church of Saint Sophia (Holy Wisdom), which be -
came the seat of the patriarchate and formed one com-
plex with the Church of Saint Irene, was completed 
under his son Constantius (r. 337–361). Thus in the 
course of the fourth century Constantinople received a 
Christian landscape. Constantine gave his capital a pre-
fect, created a senate, and invited senators from Rome to 
form a Roman upper class and a Roman-type adminis-
trative system. Constantinople came to rival the city of 
Rome and soon it was officially and unofficially called 
the New Rome. The State’s symbols remained Roman, such as Sol Invictus (the Invincible Sun) and the goddess Victory on coins Constantine minted and imperial and military standards. These symbols would gradually be 
replaced by Christian ones. Thus the ideology of Roman 
imperial power and of the Roman state merged with 
Christian ideas and symbols as they became Byzantine —   
meaning the ideology of the East Roman Empire with  a Greek-speaking and orthodox-Christian population. 
The Roman imperium that ruled over nations imposing  
a common political system and law, and a common 
Graeco-Roman civilisation, received a new Christian 
dimension.
Roman symbolism was so strong that it lasted until the 
end of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. On official state 
documents the state was called ‘Roman’, the Byzantine 
emperors bore the title of Roman emperors, and the  
citizens called themselves Romans. Latin was the official 
language of the imperial honorifics (until Heraclius,  
r. 610–641, introduced the title in Greek), the palace, 
state administration and law until the age of Justinian  
(r. 527–565).
The dynasty of Constantine ruled until 363, when Julian 
(r. 361–363), the last pagan emperor, was killed in a war against the Persians. At the end of the fourth century, 
the rule of Theodosius I (r. 379–395) was decisive for  
the future of the empire. Theodosius forbade the public 
pagan cult. Consequently persecutions began and tem-
ples were closed, destroyed, or converted into churches. 
About 392 the largest temple of the Roman Empire, the 
Serapeum at Alexandria in Egypt, was stormed by Chris-
tians. As it contained a large library, symbol of pagan 
wisdom, its destruction became the symbol of dying 
paganism. 
Theodosius left his empire to his two sons, Arcadius 
(em   peror of the East 383–408) and Honorius (emperor 
of the West 393–423). Then the Roman Empire was  
permanently divided. At that time it extended west to 
Britain and included Gaul and Spain, while to the north 
the frontier with the Germanic peoples was the Danube. 
In the Balkans the frontier was the Danube to the Black 
Sea. To the east the empire stretched to eastern Turkey 
and the Persian kingdom, including the important terri-
tories of the Middle East (Syria, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, 
and part of the Arabian Peninsula). In northern Africa it extended from Egypt to the Strait of Gibraltar. At the 
beginning of the fifth century the division line between 
the two parts extended from the Danube to northern 
Africa, leaving Dalmatia (the coast of modern Croatia)  
to the Western Empire.LAZARUS

(r. AD 98–117) and Marcus Aurelius (r. AD 161–180), built 
a new forum with a column depicting the defeat of the 
rebellious Gothic general Gainas in 400. 
At Arcadius’ death in 408 his son Theodosius II became 
sole emperor (r. 408–450). He spent all his time in Con-
stantinople, firmly establishing it as the capital of the 
East, and initiated major construction works: the new 
line of massive Theodosian Walls to (p. 155) accommo-
date the expanded capital, and its Golden Gate built of 
marble and adorned with statuary. To the six hills on 
which Constantine built his capital Constantinople, 
Theodosius added a seventh to resemble Rome. 
The empire’s intellectual and cultural climate was chang-
ing and at court it was felt that it was time for reconcilia-
tion between Christians and pagans. In the fifth century the predominance of Latin in the administration and 
army had begun to be undermined by Greek, the lan-
guage of the local populations in the Greek and Hellen-
ised provinces. The ethnic languages of local peoples in 
some provinces (Armenian, Syriac, Aramaic dialects, 
Coptic) continued to be used, but Greek remained the 
principal language of higher education, as it was during 
the Ro  man Empire. In 425 Theodosius II founded a uni-
versity in Constantinople to provide the necessary edu-cation to young men to serve in the state administration. 
Thirty-one professors were appointed, fifteen in Latin 
and sixteen in Greek. In 429 he ordered a commission to 
collect Constantine’s laws. The resulting comprehensive 
collection was completed in 438 and is known as the 
Codex Theodosianus, the first codification of Roman law 
and the basis of the Justinianic Code in the next century.  
The language of the laws is Latin. The Codex was a major and lasting achievement.
Thus, in spite of the increasing divide between the East-
ern and the Western Roman Empire, in many ways the 
Roman tradition persisted with very little changes. The administrative system remained basically Roman while 
it was becoming more centralised and more authorita-
tive, with elements of oriental despotism. Titles of the 
administration remained Roman, as did the social struc-
ture: aristocrats, plebeians, and a middle class of mer -PRIESTESS

chants and artisans. Only Christianity brought about a 
change in the social terminology. In the course of the 
fourth century the ancient political terminology of the 
city (polis) for the citizens was replaced with a termi-
nology defining the economic and social power of the 
empire’s citizens: the term ‘powerful’ was used instead 
of ‘citizen’. The members of the upper class retained the 
culture of the Roman elites longer through their dress 
and jewellery, their love of public spectacles, the archi-"
"124 CROSSROADS CONNECTIVITYtecture of their houses and other habits, such as reclining 
at dinner. These traditions continued because the upper 
class wanted to present itself as Roman and had strong 
affinities with Roman culture.
During the reign of Theodosius II, Church issues domi-
nated political life. The doctrine of Nestorius, bishop of 
Constantinople from 428 to 431, favouring Christ’s hu -
man nature, was condemned by the Third Ecumenical 
Council at Ephesus (modern Efes, Turkey) in 431. The 
Church of Alexandria promoted an emphasis on Christ’s 
divine nature, ratified by a new council at Ephesus (449). 
The next emperor, Marcian (r. 450–457), attempted to 
compromise between the two views at the Council of 
Chalcedon outside Constantinople (now Kadiköy, dis-
trict of Istanbul) in 451. Christians in Syria and Egypt 
however refused to accept the definition of the relation 
of Christ’s two natures, which made emperors react with 
persecutions or various degrees of compromise. The  
dispute over Christ’s natures was caused by different 
cultural traditions in different areas of the empire and 
manifested ethnic differences.The emperors who ascended the throne in the second half of the fifth and in the sixth centuries were army 
officers and the influence of Germanic military men 
increased at court and in political and military matters. 
The coronation of Leo I (r. 457–474) was the first corona-
tion in which the patriarch of Constantinople partici-
pated. At the coronations of Zeno (r. 474–475, 476–491) 
and Anastasius (r. 491-518) the influence of the army was 
diminishing in the imperial ceremony.
In 455 Rome was sacked by the Vandals and in 476 a pal-
ace coup by the Barbarian general Odoacer deposed the 
last Roman emperor of the Western Empire, Romulus. 
While autonomous Barbarian kingdoms were formed in 
the West, the emperor of Constantinople was the only 
one to carry the title of Roman emperor. Several wealthy 
aristocrats left Italy to settle in the East, seeking protec-
tion and new political opportunities especially in Con-
stantinople. They were accepted with honours and re -
vived an interest in Latin literature. In the early sixth century the poem of Christodorus (from the city of Cop-
tus in the Thebaid in Egypt) on the statues of the Baths 
of Zeuxippus in Constantinople artfully combines the 
Greek and Roman traditions of Byzantium: it praises at 
length the Greek cultural and historical tradition 
through Greek mythical and historical figures, and 
emphasises the Roman origins of Constantinople by 
praising Rome through Aeneas and other Virgilian 
heroes, as well as vocabulary and literary techniques.  
The Byzantine court continued to be viewed in the con-
text of its Roman roots. The Roman perspective of the 
empire was prominent in Byzantine historical writing 
too, especially in the chronicles, although it was marked 
by a Christian concept of history. Hesychius’ Chronicle 
constructs a Roman historical narrative: he begins from the Trojan War, continues with periods of Roman his-
tory, and ends with the death of Anastasius (518).
Until the middle of the sixth century the Empire of the 
East was prosperous, in spite of all the Barbarian menace. 
The cities continued to be adorned with magnificent 
Roman architecture and sculpture. The transformation to medieval urban features was not yet visible. Trade was 
flourishing. The population in many areas continued to 
increase. Construction was undertaken mainly by the 
emperors and provincial governors, and by the Church.
The sixth century is marked by the rule of Justinian  
(r. 527–565). He dreamed of reconstructing the ancient 
Roman Empire through military expansion in Italy, 
northern Africa and at the eastern frontier. The glory  MARBLE RELIQUARY

"125 THE HERITAGE OF ROME AND THE RISE OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIREof Rome was restored by an intense fortification of the 
empire’s cities and borders and by waging wars on all 
fronts. Justinian variously emphasised the affinities of 
the new Rome with the old. In the Preface of his Law  
47 (537) the Byzantine emperor declared that the Byzan-
tines descended from the mythical ancestor of the Ro -
mans, Aeneas, and that the mythical first kings of the 
Romans, Romulus and Numa, were founders of the Byz-
antine imperial rule. Imperial propaganda and literary 
works present Justinian’s military achievements and ad -
ministrative, fiscal and legal reforms in an antiquarian 
Roman spirit. Justinian’s enduring work was his reform 
and codification of Roman law, known as the Corpus 
juris civilis. The Digest (533), a compilation of excerpts 
from the writings of Roman lawyers, and the Code (534), 
a collection of imperial constitutions from the emperors 
Hadrian (r. 117–138) to Justinian, became the foundation 
of the Roman legal system of European states from the 
tenth century onward.
In spite of this Roman antiquarian spirit, Justinian 
strengthened the Christian religion in various ways.  
He closed Plato’s Academy in Athens (526), persecuted pagans and heretics, emphasised the religious tone of 
imperial ceremonies, and rebuilt the Great Church of 
Constantinople as the Hagia Sophia (532–537). The Hagia 
Sophia’s monumental scale and rising domes, variegated 
marbles and mosaics became the symbol of Constan-
tinople. The capital of the Byzantine Empire surpassed 
Rome as centre of imperial power in the sixth century, 
when the Eastern Empire was presented to the world as 
the only heir of Rome. Byzantine Constantinople rose as 
the primary city of the world for many centuries to 
come.HAGIA SOPHIA 
The Hagia Sophia (‘Holy Wisdom’) 
in Constantinople was consecrated in 537 on the site of two older churches. Famous in particular for its great dome, it is considered the epitome of Byzantine architecture. It became a mosque after the Otto -man conquest of the city in 1 453 and has served as inspiration for many other Ottoman mosques,  including five in Istanbul which  together with the Hagia Sophia  still dominate the city’s skyline."

REVIVAL,  
AD 400–1000
David Abulafia
A STEEP DECLINE?
The centuries between 400 and 1000 have generally 
been regarded as a low point in the history of the Medi-
terranean — meaning that population had declined pre-
cipitately; that trade across the sea was at a very low ebb, compared to earlier centuries; that the towns which had 
been feeding that trade had shrunk or even disappeared; 
that the high culture of the Roman Empire had been 
eroded by the less sophisticated cultures of the Barbarian 
peoples who had been entering the empire for centuries 
and who now stood on the very shores of the Mediterra-
nean, in Italy, Spain, northern Africa and so on. Inevita-
bly, this view has been challenged by new schools of his-
torians who speak more of the continuity from a Roman 
imperial past that was never forgotten and that provided 
the basis for a political revival first in the years around 
800, under Charlemagne, and then in the tenth century, 
when a Saxon dynasty claimed the crown of the Western 
Roman Empire. 
This critique turns, at least implicitly, on the assumption 
that one should not disparage the culture of the Ger -
manic and other peoples who took charge of large tracts of the empire by the sixth century. But defining a high culture is not in fact very difficult. Demand for luxury 
goods such as spices and perfumes was intense, not just 
at the top level of society. The Roman city, with its pub-
lic baths, drainage systems and arcaded markets, not to 
mention the high level of artistic production at the top end of the scale, looked and felt very different from the habitations of the incoming peoples. That said, these 
incoming peoples were keen to learn from the Romans, 
and in some areas, such as Ostrogothic Italy, they were anxious to become patrons of the arts and builders, as 
one can still see in the remains of Ravenna. Carthage had 
flourished greatly under Roman imperial rule, becoming 
one of the major centres of trade, industry and agricul-
ture in the Mediterranean (despite its supposed annihi-
lation in 146 BC). In fact, the arrival of the Vandals at the 
beginning of the fifth century AD was marked as much 
by the invaders’ determination to keep alive Roman  
theatre and other aspects of classical culture as it was by 
revolution — which mainly affected the Church, as the 
Vandals were Arian Christians who began an active per  -
se  cution of Roman Catholics. Even so, this trade centre 
began to lose its primacy, as evidence from the distribu-tion of Carthaginian amphorae (used to carry wine and 
oil across the sea) demonstrates. And the Vandal rulers, 
like the Visigoths in Spain (who were very attentive to 
Roman law codes in the sixth century), still proudly pre-
served their Germanic personal names, for Romanisa-
tion had its limits. 
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES
The real problem with the image of a Roman Empire  in steep decline after 400 is of a different order. The 
nature of change varied significantly from region to 
region. This means that it is quite impossible to speak of 
‘Europe’ as anything more than a geographical expres-
sion at this period. While the town of Luni, in north-
west Italy, disappeared off the map, Naples continued to 
play a significant role in Mediterranean trade throughout 
the Early Middle Ages. Indeed, as we will see, some new  
centres of trade emerged during the period under con-
sideration, destined for bright futures in later centuries. 
Yet the situation in the eastern Mediterranean was in 
significant respects different from that in the western 
Mediterranean, since the greater degree of urbanisation 
in the east and the less dramatic impact of invasions 
(which certainly occurred) permitted a reasonably vi -
brant economy to operate. Economic specialisation in 
town and country, with exchanges of foodstuffs for tex-
tiles, and the inflow of eastern spices and perfumes by 
way of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf gave a different 
character to the lands that remained under the direct rule 
of the Roman emperors, based since the fourth century at New Rome: Constantinople. Coastal ports such as "

The Emperor Justinian refurbished 
the port of Classe near the imperial capital of Ravenna, originally built by the Romans in the 2nd century BC. As a result, Classe became a prosperous cosmopolitan naval and trading centre and the most important port after Constanti -
nople. Ravenna’s population in -
creased, and new churches and  basilicas were built including the Sant’Apollinare in Classe, where this mosaic from the 5th–6th  century can be seen. Gaza were important centres of trade, tying the eastern 
Mediterranean to elongated routes that penetrated far 
beyond the eastern boundaries of the Roman Empire. 
Imperial rule extended as far as Sicily, despite occasional 
attacks on the island by the Goths and the Vandals. This 
position was maintained despite very severe blows: the 
Slav invasions, which overwhelmed large areas of the 
Balkans and reached down into Greece; the arrival of 
what appears to have been bubonic plague in the sixth 
century, when the Emperor Justinian was attempting to 
restore Roman imperial rule with a degree of success, as 
far west as Spain and the Maghreb. Even if the sixth and 
seventh centuries saw the eastern towns shrink, the 
shocks were not as extreme as those that had overwhel -
med the western Mediterranean.
ARAB EXPANSION AND ITS EFFECTS
Or not at first: because in the seventh century the east-
ern Mediterranean was transformed by the rise of Islam, 
resulting in the loss to the Arabs of Byzantine Syria, Pal-
estine, Egypt and northern Africa, and eventually Sicily too. Carthage was abandoned for the new city of Tunis 
close by. Perhaps the greatest blow was the loss of  
Alexandria, which had been an important outlet for  
the Egyptian grain trade, supplying first Rome and then 
Constantinople with food for their citizens. From this 
point onwards one can speak of a ‘Byzantine’ Empire,  
in the sense that the extent of rule around the Mediter -
ranean had shrunk to what is now mainly Greece, Tur -
key and the coastlines of parts of the Black Sea, with 
Constantinople as the hub; and these territories pos-"
"130 CROSSROADS CONNECTIVITYsessed added coherence, as they were mainly (though by 
no means entirely) inhabited by adherents of the Ortho-
dox Churches. 
The great question for economic historians, ever since 
Henri Pirenne’s celebrated book Mahomet et Charle­
magne (1937), has been whether the Islamic invasions or 
the earlier Barbarian ones played a greater role in the 
sundering of trade links within the Mediterranean and 
the apparent isolation of the north-western Mediterra-
nean from the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East. 
Pirenne pointed to the disappearance of gold from west-
ern coinage, notably under Charlemagne, who pursued a 
policy of silver monometallism; he described the decline 
in pepper imports, which had been of quite astonishing 
quantities in the Roman Imperial period but shrank to a 
small fraction in the fifth and sixth centuries; he also

western Europeans without the writing paper they 
needed, pushing them towards reliance on parchment 
instead which was costly and cumbersome to pro-
duce — and this in itself speaks for a decline in record-
keeping and therefore in government efficiency, al -though both certainly expanded by the late eighth 
century, under Charlemagne.
SLAVES AND SILK
Pirenne did overstate his case. There is enough evidence to show that in the sixth century there were still markets 
for eastern luxuries in the western Mediterranean, some 
of which arrived by way of the Provençal abbey of Fos.  
It is important, however, to distinguish between the 
rights that this abbey possessed to import goods such as 
pepper, and daily reality; it is quite possible that the pep-
per was a distant memory. Enough evidence also sur -
vives to show that there existed a certain amount of trans-Mediterranean traffic in the eighth and ninth cen-
turies, carrying pilgrims to the Holy Land and ambassa-
dors to Constantinople, while a slave trade bringing cap-
tives from eastern Europe as far as Spain was already in 
existence — although many of the slaves came overland 
by way of centres such as Prague and never saw the sea. One should not confuse dozens of references to sea 
travel during the eighth and ninth centuries with the 
idea that regular and profitable trade existed between 
East and West. Indeed, the Byzantine emperors carefully 
controlled the movement of prestige goods. In their em -
pire the most prestigious export was silk, some obtained 
from the Far East by way of the intermittent Silk Road to China or by way of the active maritime trade routes 
across the Indian Ocean. By the tenth century the Byz-
antines knew perfectly well how to weave fine silks and 
placed a ban on the export of top-quality purple-dyed "

ambassador of the German emperor Otto I (r. 962–973), 
Liudprand of Cremona, confessed in his reports that he 
had managed to smuggle some purple silk out of Con-
stantinople.
HOW TRADE WORKED
The best way to describe trade at this time, within and 
beyond the Mediterranean, is as ‘pedlar trade’, character -
ised by the movement of merchants carrying high-value goods in small quantities, often across very long dis-
tances. An Arabic writer described the Radhanites, a 
name no one has satisfactorily deciphered (it may refer 
to the river Rhône, and hence to Provençal merchants). 
Around 800 they were travelling by land and sea routes 
as far as Persia and even, it seems, China. They were 
Jews, although one should not take that statement too 
literally, as the western European sources tended to refer 
to ‘Jews’ and ‘Syrians’, meaning by those terms ‘mer -
chants’ rather than people of one particular religion or origin. Whether they were organised in companies and 
derived their working capital from sedentary investors is 
unknown, but seems unlikely. Some enjoyed the protec-
tion of the Merovingian and Carolingian rulers of Fran-
cia, whom they were able to supply with jewels and 
other luxury items.HUB OF AFRICA
The city of Mahdia on Tunisia’s east 
coast, on the site of the Roman city Aphrodisium, was given its present name by the Fatimids in 921. They made it the capital of Ifriqiya (Is-lamic northern Africa), and its port served as a trading and military centre that connected the Mediter -
ranean with the African hinterland. The traces of the ramparts that sur -
rounded it as well as the two por -
tals protecting its entrance are still visible today.

Silk was one of the most important 
commodities of the Byzantine Em -
pire. It was also used as a diplomat -

tine silks were used in clothing, as wall hangings and in book bind -
ings; silks also survive from the graves of important figures and in reliquaries, but much of this ephemeral material was lost in the humid western climate. This mag -
nificent polychrome silk depicting a chariot was manufactured in Constantinople c. AD 700 and served as Charlemagne’s shroud when he was buried in the Palatine Chapel at Aachen in 81 4.CAESAREA MARITIMA
The city and harbour of Caesarea 
Maritima were built under Herod the Great during c.22–10 BC  near the site of a former Phoeni -
cian naval base. It served as the provincial capital of Roman Judaea,  
Roman Syria Palaestina, and Byz -
antine Palaestina Prima. The city became an important early centre of Christianity during the Byzan -
tine period, but was mostly aban -
doned following the Muslim con -
quest of 640. It appears that the harbour remained in use during the early Umayyad period, but eventually silted up and fell out  of use by the 9th century.In the Islamic Mediterranean, on the other hand, the 
Jewish presence in trade became more and more visible 
in the tenth and eleventh centuries, to judge from the 
remarkable collection of commercial letters preserved 
for centuries in a synagogue in Old Cairo. The Cairo 
Genizah papers (a genizah being a synagogue storeroom) 
survived because the Jews were reluctant to destroy any -
thing that might carry the name of God, and they could not be bothered — in Cairo at least — to check the vast 
volume of paper they accumulated, which included a great many merchant letters. In one direction, the Cairo 
merchants travelled as far as India in search of spices and 
other exotica; in the other direction they were very ac -
tive on the coast of what is now Tunisia, at the impor -
tant new town of Mahdia, and in Sicily, conquered by the Muslims in the ninth century. Some reached Spain  
as well. They were experts in the silk trade, treating silk 
as an investment as well as an article of trade. Knowledge 
was the key to success — which explains the letters with

Islamic lands should also be noted: some extra taxes,  
but no coercion to convert and a general acceptance by 
Muslim princes that they ruled over an ethnically and 
religiously diverse population.
VENICE
How the West heaved itself out of the trough of com-mercial depression is still a mystery. Although most his-
torians would point to the twelfth century as the time when expansion became particularly vigorous, there were important antecedents, mainly in Italy. Venice 
emerged from the muddy silt of the northern Adriatic. 
At the beginning it was a community of fishermen and 
salt manufacturers, but the profits from these enterprises 
led the Venetians further afield, to the shores of Dalma-
tia; then they penetrated ever deeper into the Byzantine 
Empire, receiving a trade privilege from the Byzantine 
emperor in the late ninth century. At that time the city 
was only slowly beginning to cohere. An attack on the 
lagoon by the Carolingians at the end of the eighth cen-
tury encouraged the inhabitants of scattered islets to 
gather at a single defensible point, the Rivo Alto or High 
Bank, which became ‘Rialto’ in Venetian dialect. Even so, 
early Venice was not one place but several, with a multi-plicity of bishops and communities, from Grado in the 
north to Chioggia in the south. Later, around 1000, the "

The astrolabe is a navigation in -
strument based on measuring tilt 
that was invented in the Hellenistic period and continued to be used throughout the Byzantine era. It was further developed and widely used in the medieval Islamic world, also as a way of finding the Qibla, the direction of Mecca. Astrolabe from Baghdad, copper, AD 950. Venetians played off the Ottonians while keeping up 
vestigial ties with Constantinople, which ensured that 
the citizens of Venice could develop their own commer -
cial network without too much interference. 
AMALFI
Much the same applies to the other town that earned  
a reputation as a centre of trade between East and West  
at this period, Amalfi (on the coast of Campania, Italy), 
by which must be understood not just the minute town 
with that name, but its close neighbours Maiori, Minori, 
Ravello, Cetara and so on, which together formed what 
outsiders saw as a significant commercial community. 
Here too the duke, like the Venetian doge, was techni-
cally an official of the Byzantine emperor; here too the 
emperors would occasionally bestow grandiloquent 
titles of honour, but in practice the relationship was a 
very loose one — close enough, though, to win the 
Amalfitans trading rights on the Golden Horn. Amalfi also developed close relations with the Muslims in Sicily 
and Tunisia, and provided a channel through which the 
luxuries of the Byzantine and Islamic world reached the 
papal court in Rome and the wealthy abbey of Monte-
cassino not far away, whose agents the Amalfitans were. 
They minted a gold coinage, proof that they were able to 
tap into the flow of gold that reached northern Africa 
and the Byzantine Empire. But the fact that ‘Saracen’ 
raiders had become a scourge for the inhabitants of southern Italy seems not to have worried them greatly; 
indeed, they were accused of collaboration with the 
Muslims. 
NEW BEGINNINGS
After 1100 Amalfi was to be overtaken by north-Italian cities — not just Venice, but Pisa and Genoa as well.  
The Pisans were already proving themselves at sea around 1000, helping to keep Sardinia clear of the  
Muslim pirates from Spain who were trying to conquer 
the island (a vain hope in reality). The other great naval 
power of the future, Genoa, had much more modest 
beginnings. It had been a Byzantine base until the middle 
of the seventh century, but the region was experiencing 
severe enough economic difficulties for the leading his-
torian of early Genoa to call the area ‘Dark-Age Liguria’. 
Around 1000 the Genoese still tended to look inwards  
at the valleys and mountainsides of a region that could 
produce little apart from the oil, nuts and herbs that 
make up its most famous product, pesto. Much the  same can be said of Barcelona, which experienced a  
flash-in-the-pan period of wealth in the eleventh cen-
tury and then relapsed into relative insignificance until 
about 1200. The real economic power-houses in Spain 
lay much further to the south, in al-Andalus, Islamic 
Spain, where the courts of Caliph Abd ar-Rahman III in 
the tenth century and of several of the local kings who 
ruled southern Spain in the eleventh century were 
places of great magnificence.
By 1000, then, there were glimmers of recovery in the 
West, but not yet the bright light of full-scale expansion. 
Very slowly the Mediterranean was coming together as 
an integrated trading area, but the most successful areas 
were still those under Islamic or Byzantine rule. What 
we now call Europe was very fragmented and it would 
certainly be a grave mistake to assume that a ‘European identity’ came into being then, if indeed it ever would  
do so."

MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONS 
JEWS, CHRISTIANS, 
AND MUSLIMS FROM 
LATE ANTIQUITY TO 
EARLY MIDDLE AGES
Barbara Roggema
INTERTWINED HISTORIES 
The three great monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christi-
anity and Islam, not only share their core belief in one 
God, they also have common roots in the social realities 
and the spiritual and intellectual traditions of the Near 
East. Although their very beginnings lie centuries apart, 
much of their formation took place in parallel contem-
poraneous developments. In Antiquity Jews settled in 
most of the large cities around the Mediterranean. From 
Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages there are indi-
cations of Jewish presence in many parts of Europe.  
Rabbanite Judaism, which was to become mainstream 
Judaism in later history, postdates the rise of Christian-
ity. It evolved in the period from the second to the sixth 
or seventh century, when the Babylonian Talmud was 
compiled. During the same time period, Christianity 
spread around Europe and parts of Asia and Africa. The 
definition of Christian orthodoxy (‘correct belief’) was  
a long and tortuous process, leading to the creed agreed 
upon at the Council of Chalcedon (451). Arian Christian-
ity, condemned as a heresy in 325, nevertheless survived 
in Europe for centuries.Many parts of the Christian world never came to accept the Chalcedonian creed. In the Near East, Africa and 
Asia, the burgeoning Christian communities adhered  
to divergent creeds. The Church of the East (‘Nestorians’ 
or ‘duophysites’) emphasised Christ’s humanity as dis -
tinct from his divinity, whereas the ‘miaphysites’ or 
‘monophysites’ believed that Christ’s divinity engulfed 
his human nature. This became the doctrine of the 
Copt ic Church in Egypt, the Syrian-Orthodox Church  
in the Fertile Crescent, and the Armenian and Ethiopian Churches. The theological differences that caused the 
rifts between the various Churches were also expres-
sions of autonomy and self-determination on the part  
of Christian communities far removed from Rome and 
Constantinople. 
The complete separation of Christianity from Judaism 
was a process that was completed only about a century 
before the rise of Islam, although references to moments 
of shared worship, such as Christians attending Jewish festivals in Syria, have survived from as late as the eighth 
century. In the earliest Christian responses to Judaism, 
Jews were accused of rejecting Christ as the Messiah,  
of killing him and of being blind to the deeper meaning 
of the Hebrew Bible. At the same time, the Jews were 
regarded as witnesses to Christ’s life and as a living re -
membrance of his identity. The acceptance of Christian-
ity in the Roman Empire under Constantine the Great, 
in the early fourth century, made the Church’s rejection 
of Judaism more definitive. Legislation regarding the 
Jews became more discriminatory in the following cen-
turies, especially under the Byzantine emperor Justinian 
(r. 527–65). In the early seventh century both the Visig-
oths and the Byzantines ordered forced conversions of 
the Jews. 
The balance of power suddenly changed when Islam 
emerged in the Middle East in the seventh century. 
Within decades, much of the eastern Mediterranean and 
the Middle East was conquered by Arab armies. In the 
early eighth century this new movement reached as far 
as the Iberian Peninsula in the west and up to the Indus River in the east. The conquests often entailed negoti-
ated surrender rather than bloodshed or forced conver -
sion. Jews and Christians could in many ways proceed with life as before. Because they were monotheists with 
their own holy scripture, they counted as ‘People of the 
Book’, who could live as ‘protected people’ or dhimmis. 
For this they had to pay an extra tax, however, and they had to accept some discriminatory measures. Some of "
"139 THE THREE MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONSOLD CAIRO: THE BEN EZRA SYNAGOGUE
The Ben Ezra Synagogue in Fustat 
(Old Cairo) probably goes back to the 9th century. It was destroyed in the early 1 1 century during Caliph al-Hakim’s attacks on Jews and Christians in Egypt. In the 1 9th century the structure was rebuilt on its ancient foundations. In a walled-off chamber functioning as a stor -
age room for writings, the so-called genizah, about 1 40,000 documents were found that shed light on the history of medieval Egypt and on Jewish life in par -
ticular. the stipulations resembled older Christian regulations 
with regard to the Jews: the dhimmis were not allowed 
to testify against Muslims, to proselytise, or to build new 
places of worship. 
In the early phase, Islam profiled itself as a religion for 
the Arabs. The building of the Dome of the Rock (c.692) 
in Jerusalem is seen as a decisive step towards Islam as a 
universal religion, triumphing over all other religions. 
This building project took place during the Umayyad 
Caliphate (661–750), which had chosen Syria as its cen-
tre. The Dome of the Rock not only occupied a symbolic 
location on the Temple Mount but it also contained in -
scriptions of verses from the Qur’an that criticise Chris-
tians for their belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation 
and summon people to true monotheism. From this 
time on, Middle-Eastern Christians began to formulate 
responses to the claims of Islam, while on the Muslim 
side the ideas of Muhammad as the final prophet and the restorer of Abrahamic monotheism were elaborated. Jews and Christians were portrayed as stubborn and 
quarrelsome corruptors of the revelation they had orig-
inally received. Fortunately such confrontations of ideas 
did not often lead to deterioration in the relations 
between rulers and ruled. On the contrary: the follow -"

BAGHDAD, CORDOBA, CAIRO:  
CULTURAL BLOOM AND CONVIVENCIA
In the middle of the eighth century, a revolution from the east overthrew the Umayyad Caliphate in Syria. The 
new Muslim rulers, the Abbasids, created a capital in 
Iraq: the ‘City of Peace’, more commonly called Baghdad. 
From this time onwards, non-Arab Muslims received a 
social status equal to Arabs and conversion to Islam in -
tensified. The region of Iran and central Asia opened up 
to Baghdad — soon to be a city of global importance. The 
rich agriculture of Iraq as well as the international trade in gold, silver, slaves, hides, paper, silk and other com-
modities brought immense wealth, creating a fertile 
ground for the cultivation of art and scholarship. The 
Abbasid Caliphs took a personal interest in learning, 
partly out of humanistic curiosity and partly with an eye 
to the legitimisation of their rule in universal terms that OLD CAIRO: THE HANGING CHURCH 
The Church of the Virgin Mary  
or al-Mu‘allaqa, ‘the Hanging Church’, is the most famous church in Cairo. It belongs to the Coptic Orthodox community and pro -
bably goes back to the time when  Fustat (Old Cairo) was founded  after the Muslim conquest in the 7th century. It was likely built on the site of an older church; the nave is suspended over a Roman for -

transgressed religious boundaries. They famously spon-
sored the translation of Greek, Syriac and Pahlavi texts 
into Arabic. Works of Euclid, Galen, Ptolemy and Aristo-
tle were translated and saved from oblivion. For these 
translations the Abbasids hired many Christian (and 
other non-Muslim) scientists, who were well versed in 
Greek, Syriac and Arabic. Hunayn ibn Ishaq (d. 873),  
a Christian, was one of the most famous translators. As 
chief physician to the court he also had a close personal 
relationship with the Caliph. Jewish physicians were 
well respected too and were frequently found at Muslim 
courts, both in the Islamic East and West. Religious dif-
ference does not seem to have stood in the way of a good 
career. Nevertheless, there are incidents of interpersonal 
relations breaking down because of occasional mistrust 
of non-Muslims in high-profile positions.
This Golden Age of the early Abbasids was soon to be 
mirrored by the prosperity and cultural bloom in two 
different Muslim centres of power. Quite well known is 
the Umayyad period in Iberia (Spain), especially during "
"141 THE THREE MONOTHEISTIC RELIGIONSthe tenth century. The caliphs resided in the city of  
Cordoba, which they transformed into a centre of secular 
and religious learning. One of the remarkable aspects  
of the time that modern interpreters have consistently 
commented on is the exceptional symbiosis between 
Muslims and Jews. The Jewish community thrived, in 
contrast to the late-Visigoth period in which Jews were 
forced to convert to Christianity. Hasday ibn Shaprut  
(d. 975) is a splendid example of a Jewish dignitary at  
the Umayyad court. His dynamic career as physician, 
customs official, diplomat, translator, head of the Jewish 
community and Hebrew scholar is dazzling. He is famed 
for his edition of Dioscorides’ De materia medica (Mate­
rials of Medicine, first century AD) in collaboration with 
a Greek monk. His career also reveals the contemporary 
network of long-distance relations. Not only was he in 
contact with the Christian rulers in the north of the pen-
insula but also with the emperor of East-Francia, the 
Byzantine emperor, the Khazars and the Jews in Iraq. For 
Jewish learning contact with the scholars in Baghdad 
had been important up to his time, but due to Hasday’s

Leaf from a 10th-century manu -
script of Exodus 1:1–8:5. The text 
is in Hebrew written in Arabic char -
acters, with Hebrew vowel-points (in red) and the accents (in green). It was common for Jews in the  Middle East to speak Arabic and  to write it with Hebrew letters. efforts Jewish learning in Iberia became a world of  
its own.
In between these two great centres, Baghdad and Cor -
doba, lay another powerful capital: Cairo. In the tenth century the Ismaili (Shi’ite) Fatimids had come to Egypt 
to found a counter-caliphate to that of the Abbasids. Not -
withstanding their radical and elitist view of Islam —  
which was at odds with egalitarian Sunni be  liefs — as 
well as almost incessant hostilities with the powers 
around the Mediterranean, they created the perfect  
circumstances for a prosperous society that thrived on 
trade over the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean.  
The Fatimids actively pursued learning too, and, with 
the exception of the Caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah  
(r. 996–1021), they gave much freedom to dhimmis and 
non-Ismaili Muslims. Their most famous legacy today  
is the Azhar University, which was founded in the 969 
as an Ismaili college. 
ARABISATION OF JUDAISM AND CHRISTIANITY:  
THE GROWTH OF A COMMON CULTURE
These prosperous cultures around the Mediterranean were ruled by Muslims, but dhimmis contributed to 
many aspects of society and were part of what has been 
called ‘Islamicate’ culture. The main reason why Jews 
and Christians managed to become assimilated to this 
extent was the fact that they spoke Arabic. With the 
early expansion of Islam, Arabic had become an increas-
ingly important language. When the Islamic rulers sub-
jected the Sassanid Empire and large parts of the Byzan-
tine Empire in the seventh century, Arabic soon replaced 
Persian and Greek as the administrative language used in 
the centralised caliphate. 
In the following centuries, the populations in the cali-
phate began to use Arabic increasingly and some lan-
guages, such as Coptic and Greek, gradually disappeared. 
This change was occasionally lamented by dhimmis who 
resisted conversion to Islam, regarded Arabs as foreign, 
and associated the language with the Qur’an. Yet the 
adoption of a common language created channels of "
"142 CROSSROADS CONNECTIVITYsocial and geographical mobility and of intellectual ex -
change. Both in the east and the west of the Islamic 
world, members of the three faiths exchanged ideas. 
Jews and Christians translated the Bible and wrote com-
mentaries in Arabic. This meant that Jews, Christians 
and Muslims could read each other’s works. The Arabic 
translation of the Torah and its commentary by the Jew -
ish scholar Saadia Gaon (d. 942), for example, was used and copied by Coptic Christians. Muslim scholars were 
very interested in the Bible. They used the Arabic trans-
lations to search for ancient predictions of Muhammad 
and for narrations of the ancient prophets to which the 
Qur’an merely alluded. They also read the Bible closely 
to prove that it had suffered corruption during its trans-
mission. Jews and Christians, on the other hand, became 
thoroughly acquainted with the Qur’an and pointed out 
contradictions in it. It may well be that this is why the 
dhimmis were prohibited from teaching the Qur’an to 
their children. Here one sees how detailed knowledge 
about one religion that was available to members of 
another often could lead to fierce polemics. Yet such 
confrontations also fuelled the search for a common rationality through which ultimately the one truth could be expressed. A group of Jews in Iraq, probably following 
the ideas of Anan ben David (d. c.795), called for a ratio -
nal exegetical approach to the Bible and for the abandon-ment of the Talmud. From them grew the Karaites, 
‘scripturalists’, who became a major branch of Judaism 
throughout the world, in opposition to the Rabbanites 
whose beliefs and practices the Karaites largely rejected. 
A rational approach to theology became common among 
members of all three religions, who exchanged ideas in SYNAGOGUE MOSAIC FROM SYRIA

versions from one faith to the other were not a rare 
occurrence. A common philosophical terminology was 
used by followers of all three religions. In addition, it has 
often been stressed how Jews and Muslims shared their 
intense love for Arabic poetry, which was undoubtedly 
the most enduring common cultural expression. 
Another aspect of the status of Arabic as lingua franca 
was its convenience in international trade, where it must 
have contributed to the prosperous economy in the 
whole Muslim world of the time. The role of Jews in this 
trade and in Muslim society at large can be reconstructed 
by means of the thousands of Judaeo-Arabic documents 
that have been recovered from the storehouse (genizah) 
of the Ben Ezra synagogue in Old Cairo (Fustat). Detail-
 ed studies of these documents create vivid images of a 
world dominated by long-distance contacts and inter -
communal communications.   
CRISES IN INTERRELIGIOUS RELATIONS 
This society in which Jews, Christians and Muslims had 
common tastes and ideas which they could expresswith-out hesitation, despite religious difference, can be la -
belled ‘pluralist’. In comparison with Christian Europe, 
these periods in Islamic society can be characterised as 
tolerant. Some modern interpreters have gone so far as 
to speak of an ‘interfaith utopia’. This is surely an exag-
geration, because Islamic society maintained symbolic 
and tangible ways to mark Jews and Christians as infe-
rior. Nonetheless, the infrequency of violence and per -
secution deserves to be stressed.However one characterises the interreligious dynamics 
of the period up to the year 1000, there is no doubt that 
they changed soon after that. The eleventh century was  
a turning point in the history of the relations between 
the three religions. The Fatimid caliph al-Hakim bi- 
Amr Allah (r. 996–1021) transgressed Islamic law by 
instigating attacks on Jews and Christians and forcing 
them to convert to Islam or to leave. In 1066 the Jews  
in the Berber Kingdom of Granada were massacred as 
punishment for the allegedly arrogant behaviour of the 
Jewish chief political adviser to the king. From the Chris-
tian side a more sustained effort was made to rid Europe of non-Christians. Jews, Muslims, and heterodox groups

Sigeric’s exact date of birth is unknown, 
although some authors place it around 
950. He was educated at Glastonbury 
Abbey, an ancient and prestigious  
monastery in south-west England, 
where he took holy orders. Around  
975 or 980 he was elected abbot of St Augustine’s in Canterbury, one of the most important Christian centres in the 
British Isles. In 985/986, he was con -
secrated bishop of Ramsbury, a post considered at that time to be the step 
prior to reaching the highest ecclesiasti -
cal office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, the primate of the see of Canterbury.  
A few years later, in 990, Sigeric was appointed archbishop of Canterbury.As head of the Anglo-Saxon Church, 
Sigeric acted as counsellor to King 
Æthelred II the Unready (r. 978–101 3 
and 101 4–101 6) at a time when invad -
ing Danes once again threatened the integrity of the Anglo-Saxon territories. 
In fact, after a long period of external peace following the reconquest of the 
English territories occupied by the 
Danes (Danelaw) by King Edgar, Æthel -
red’s father, the Scandinavians were once again making incursions. In 991  
a large Danish fleet attacked the south-
eastern coasts of Britain. It seems that 
Sigeric was among those who advised 
the king to pay a tribute to the invaders in exchange for ending their attacks. 
Æthelred handed over 10,000 Roman pounds of silver (3,300 kg), but the 
truce was short-lived and the incursions 
soon resumed. In fact, shortly before 
his death in October 994, Sigeric him -
self was obliged to pay a large sum to the Danes to stop them from burning down Canterbury Cathedral.
We know little else of Sigeric’s life.

This journey would have been just one 
of many made by monarchs, prelates  
or simple pilgrims to Rome, if Sigeric 
had not described it in a diary. This 
priceless text, known as Sigeric’s Itiner ­
ary, survived in an early-eleventh-cen -
tury copy now kept in the British Library 
in London (MS Cotton Tiberius B. v, 23v–24r). Sigeric’s Itinerary is the ear -
liest preserved description of one of the most important medieval communica -
tions routes, which had various names over the centuries, including Via Romea, 
Chemin des Anglais and Via Franci -
gena.The itinerary was the heir to the natural 
routes that had linked northern Europe and the Mediterranean. It connected 
important Christian sites between Can -
terbury and Rome, including Reims, Besançon, Saint-Maurice (Switzerland), 
Pavia, Siena and Viterbo. It crossed three mountain ranges (the Jura  Massif, the Alps and the Apennines) 
and passed through thirteen modern-
day regions in four European countries 
(not counting Vatican City). The origi -
nal route was some 1 700 km long, which Sigeric described in 79 subman ­
siones or stages. This long itinerary was 
marked by many monuments and spec -
tacular scenery, some of which are now 
World Heritage Sites. The Via Fran -
cigena was not only travelled by pil -
grims and ecclesiastics, but also by arti -
sans, merchants, bankers, students and soldiers. It was a route for the exchange 
of goods, beliefs, ideas and knowledge 
between the Europeans of those centu -
ries. For its historical value, the Council 
of Europe recognised the Via Franci -

Sigeric’s death.
CROSSING THE ALPS
As he travelled the Via Francigena, Sigeric 
crossed the Alps by way of the Great St  Bernard Pass, the most ancient pass through the Western Alps. Crossing the Alps was dangerous and could only be done from June to September. In winter, snow in the pass can be as much as 10 m deep, and temperature may drop as low as -30 °C. In AD 43, the Romans built a road through the pass, as well as a mansio (inn) at the top and a temple to Jupiter Poeninus. The Romans controlled the pass until the first half of the 5th century AD. Fragments of the marble temple were later incorporated into many structures of the village on the Swiss side of the pass; the ancient Roman road can still be seen on the hillside above the modern road.

IN EUROPE, 
AD 300–1000
Alexander Sarantis
INTRODUCTION
Two major political changes that affected warfare be -
tween 300 and 1000 were the demise of the West Ro -
man Empire by 476 and that of the East Roman Empire 
by 650. The former was replaced by a number of Ger -
manic states, the latter by the Muslim Umayyad Cali-phate and a much smaller Christian Byzantine Empire. 
These developments had a profound impact on the or  -
ganisation and culture of armed forces across Europe, even though their deployment, equipment and battles 
remained surprisingly similar in certain ways.
This chapter will outline some of the characteristics of 
Late Roman (AD 284–476/641) and post-Roman (476/ 
641–1000) warfare. It will contain marginally more ma -
terial on the former because more historical sources are 
available. Whereas the Romans and later the Byzantines 
were fascinated by war and wrote handbooks and histo-
ries on the topic, early-medieval western texts, written 
mostly by churchmen or monks, have less to say about 
the details of military encounters. Archaeological evi-
dence, especially of fortifications, infrastructure, weap-
onry and equipment, has also made an important contri-
bution to our understanding of warfare from 300 to 1000. 
ORGANISATION
The Late Roman Empire was a centralised state capable of raising taxes in order to provision, equip and pay a 
full-time, professional standing army. At its maximum 
extent, the army numbered 650,000 men, although  
this number was at least halved after the West Roman Empire ceased to exist in 476. These soldiers were mostly conscripted, although veterans’ sons were also 
expected to enlist and some poorer provincials volun-
teered. Non-Romans were recruited from beyond the 
frontiers and allowed to settle on imperial land after their military service. 
The Roman army was divided into mobile field armies 
whose soldiers were called comitatenses, and units of 
frontier soldiers called limitanei. Naval forces, number -
ing at least 30,000, were stationed at bases along the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts and on the Danube 
and Rhine frontiers. 
The smaller states in the West after 476 lacked the cen-
tralised pay and recruitment structures of the Roman 
Empire. In the sixth century, armies in states such as 
Gothic Italy were paid from the revenues of landed es -
tates or with donations of land, while in regions such as 
southern Gaul, local aristocrats recruited private armed 
forces. By the seventh century, Anglo-Saxon and Franco-
Merovingian leaders had come to rely on their own war 
bands of loyal followers as well as those of aristocratic 
landowning subjects. Rather than salaries, these subjects 
received the support and protection of their kings as well 
as grants of land in return for periodic military service. 
The link between landholding and military obligation 
was formalised during the Carolingian period from the eighth to the tenth century. Army sizes tended to be 
smaller in early-medieval Frankish Europe than in the 
Late Roman period, 5–10,000 men at most. Campaign-
ing Late Roman armies numbered between 10,000 and 
30,000. 
The Byzantine Empire, meanwhile, developed what be -
came known as theme armies and navies in Asia Minor 
and the Balkans in response to wide-spread invasions 
and the military threat posed by the Umayyad and later 
Abbasid Caliphates from the seventh to the ninth centu-
ries. These forces comprised a mixture of professional 
troops and local soldier-farmers, conscripted annually 
for military campaigning in the summer months by each 
theme (military-administrative region). By the tenth 
cen  tury however the political recovery of the Byzantine 
Empire coincided with the demise of the defensive theme military system and the re-establishment of pro -
fessional standing armies. 
FORTIFICATIONS AND CAMPAIGN STRATEGY 
Late Roman emperors paid for the construction and 
maintenance of a vast system of fortifications. These "
"151 WARFARE IN EUROPE, AD 300–1000were far larger, more sophisticated and more numerous 
than those built in the early Imperial period (first cen-
tury BC–second century AD). Together with military 
bases and surveillance points, they were constructed  
at urban settlements distant from frontier regions. The 
government also maintained an enormous network of 
roads, ports and bridges, and a postal system. 
The Romans’ infrastructure made it easier for their 
armies to campaign within imperial provinces than be -FORTRESS OF RAM, SERBIA, LOWER DANUBE FRONTIER
The border of the Roman Empire 
(limes) ran through Europe along the Rhine and Danube rivers. The fortress of Ram, situated on a steep slope on the banks of the Danube in present-day Veliko Gradište,  Serbia, was built in the early Impe -
rial Age as a settlement where cav -
alry units were stationed to guard the Roman frontier.yond the frontiers where they did not have such good 
logistical support. Roman military campaigns from the 
fourth to the sixth century in Gaul and the Balkans, for 
example, often consisted of attrition warfare, designed 
to wear down and deter foreign raiders (including the 
Alemanni in the West and Goths, Huns and Slavs in the 
East) who lacked the organisational capacity to support 
themselves on campaign for long periods and were inept 
at besieging the walled settlements. Only occasionally 
were major battles fought, the Battle of Adrianople (now 
Edirne, Turkey) — in which the Goths annihilated the 
East Roman field army in 376 — being a good example. 
Pitched battles and sieges were more frequent in the 
Gothic and Vandal Wars between the 530s and 560s, 
because these were fought by the Eastern Roman army 
to take Italy and northern Africa back from the Goths 
and the Vandals. 
The early-medieval Frankish and Anglo-Saxon king-
doms could not afford to maintain the sophisticated 
infrastructure of the Roman Empire. Following the de -
mise of the Western Empire in 476, fortresses fell out of 
use, city walls were taken down or abandoned, and mountain tracks in Alpine regions replaced major routes. 
While hilltop forts were used in some regions, it was 
only with the rise of the more centralised Carolingian 
Empire in the late eighth century and the threat of the 
Vikings in the ninth that fortifications came to be con-
structed on a larger scale in north-west Europe. These 
were rarely as sophisticated as Late Roman fortifications 
however, examples from the Frankish-Saxon border -
lands being small forts built from perishable materials such as wood and thatch. 
These developments naturally influenced the types of 
campaigns fought in western Europe in the Early Middle 
Ages. In the late sixth to eighth centuries, warfare be -
tween Franco-Merovingian and Anglo-Saxon aristocrats 
and states consisted often of localised and in some peri-
ods wide-spread raiding and harrying, with compara-
tively regular pitched battles and few major sieges. By 
the Carolingian era, however, fortifications were playing 
a more important role in campaigns of territorial expan-
sion fought in regions such as Saxony, Hungary and 
Aquitaine (south-west France), although sieges were still uncommon. 
In the Byzantine Empire, fortifications proliferated in 
response to the Muslim threat. Byzantine strategy in the 
seventh to ninth centuries was characterised by what 
might be termed a defence-in-depth approach, Muslim "
"152 CROSSROADS CONNECTIVITYarmies being allowed to travel deep into Byzantine terri-
tory before being picked off and worn down by the har -
rying tactics of regional theme army units, met at sea, or forced to besiege heavily defended cities such as Con-
stantinople. The more aggressive, powerful Byzantine 
professional army of the tenth century, by contrast, was 
likelier to seek out and confront enemy forces in pitched 
battles. 
BATTLEFIELD TACTICS
Battles were risky affairs and — in theory — were only 
fought when leaders believed they had a good chance of 
winning. The main development in Late Antique battle tactics was the increasing importance of cavalry, which 
played a key role in battles such as Adrianople in 376 and 
which, by the sixth century, were dominating some bat-
tles in the Eastern Roman conquests of Italy and Africa. Hun groups from the Eurasian steppe introduced light, 
mobile mounted archery skills, while the Persian and Sarmatian influence from the East resulted in the Roman 
army adopting units of heavily armoured shock cavalry. 
Well-trained and disciplined Roman infantry however 
remained the mainstay of Roman armies, which were now strengthened by Germanic recruits, also known 
mainly for their infantry skills. 
In the post-Roman West, the distinction between tacti-
cally specialised cavalry and infantry fighters became blurred. Germanic Franks and Anglo-Saxons could fight 
on horseback or dismount and fight on foot, depending 
on the circumstances. Generally speaking, however, 
Anglo-Saxons and Vikings relied less on cavalry. It is 
sometimes argued that at the same time Carolingian 
armies consisted predominantly of mounted troops and 
that the eighth to ninth centuries witnessed the emer -
gence of the heavily armoured European knight. A num-ber of scholars have refuted this suggestion, pointing out 
that Carolingian armies also operated in mountainous 
conditions where fighting battles on horseback would 
not have been practical. 
The nature of battles remained broadly similar through-
out Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Infantry 
forces were usually arrayed in dense lines, known as pha-
lanxes in the Graeco-Roman, or shield walls in the Ger -
manic or Viking worlds. In Late Antiquity at least, heavy A WARRIOR’S GRAVE

"153 WARFARE IN EUROPE, AD 300–1000infantry tended to be positioned near the front and light 
infantry closer to the rear of battle formations. When 
cavalry troops were also involved, they typically lined  
up on the flanks of infantry formations. Battles normally 
commenced with light infantry hurling projectiles in  
an attempt to ‘soften up’ the other side before the two 
armies came together, although this missile-throwing 
phase seems to have been less common in the early-
medieval West. 
Battles were decided when one side managed to encircle 
the other, break through its main infantry lines, capture 
enemy standards, or kill the enemy leader or prominent 
generals. This could provoke a panicked response on  
the losing side. It was in the chaos of a retreat that most 
soldiers lost their lives. One way commanders could 
pre  pare for such disasters was to keep troops in reserve 
to plug the gaps if their front lines were breached and prevent troops from fleeing. 
In the Byzantine Empire, few battles were fought from 
the seventh to the ninth century, when skirmishing  
and attrition warfare were more common. But from  
the tenth century onward, the tagmata army (profes-sional central standing army based near Constantinople;  
tagmata originally means ‘battalions’) once more began

weapon with the Franks from the 5th to the 7th century. Isidore of Seville (see p. 1 6 7) tells us that for this reason it was called the francis ­

handle; the Byzantine writer Proco -pius reports that the Franks would throw the axes in one volley before engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Iron, l. 1 8 cm, AD 460–550,  found in Neuwied-Heddesdorf (Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany).to show the tactical specialisation and variety of Late Ro -
man armies, deploying disciplined, well-drilled infantry 
phalanxes as well as light infantry and light and heavy 
cavalry. 
WEAPONRY AND EQUIPMENT 
Weaponry and equipment changed little across this period. Long spatha swords, spears of different lengths, 
axes (used for example by the Franks in the fifth to sev -
enth centuries and later by the Vikings) and a variety of projectiles including smaller spears and plumbata 
throwing darts were all used by foot soldiers. Archery 
was common in Late Antiquity and in early-medieval 
Gaul, but less so in Anglo-Saxon England. Cavalry troops 
were armed with lances, spears and swords as well as 
small, circular shields.  
Defensive equipment typically consisted of chain-mail,  
scale or lamellar armour, and large oval bossed shields. 
Helmets included the so-called ridge helmet (p. 154) and 
Spangenhelm (see p. 98). In the Late Roman period, only 
the front-row troops were heavily armoured, while 
there is some debate concerning the degree to which 
later Frankish or Anglo-Saxon troops were all uniformly 
heavily protected with helmets and armour. It is possible 
instead that many relied on boiled leather or padded 
rather than metal armour. In Late Roman times, the 
horses of heavy cavalry troops wore armour, as did their 
riders (see p. 55). There is no evidence for such heavily defended cavalry in the post-Roman West. 
In the Byzantine Empire, theme troops were poorly 
equipped compared to their Roman predecessors. Many 
possessed only rudimentary or no defensive equipment, 
no helmets and relied on a sword, spear and shield. The 
tenth-century tagmata armies would have been better 
armed, with shields, scale armour, and a variety of weap-
ons. 
SIEGE WARFARE 
Between the fourth and sixth centuries major fortifica-
tions were erected along the Rhine, Danube and eastern 
frontiers, and at major cities in the Balkans, Asia Minor, 
Italy and northern Africa. Sieges were thus a prominent 
feature of Roman-Persian warfare in the East in the 
fourth and sixth-seventh centuries, and in the Balkans, 
especially in the age of Attila in the mid-fifth century 
and during the Avaro-Slav invasions of the late sixth to 
seventh centuries. The Gothic Wars in Italy between the 
East Roman Empire and the Gothic Kingdom (535–561) "

For long periods of Late Antiquity, however, sieges were 
comparatively infrequent in Gaul and in the Balkans. 
Because harrying or raiding were the main aims of most 
military campaigns, armies often chose not to waste 
their time on fortified settlements. Only when an army 
was aiming to capture territory would it lay siege to  
certain settlements, as was the case in the Gothic War. 
Even then, there are very few examples of fortified  
settlements being captured by force, mainly because 
enormous fortifications were difficult to breach and 
defenders had stockpiles of provisions. Most sieges  
were settled when either the besiegers or the besieged 
gave up, usually because they ran out of food or water. 
When attackers did attempt to capture fortified bases  
by force, they had various options: go over the walls 
using siege towers, ladders or battering rams, or under, 
by digging mines. Artillery pieces were used by attackers 
and defenders. In Late Antiquity these included torsion-
sprung crossbows, and from the late sixth century, ten -
sion-powered traction trebuchet stone throwers. 
In the early-medieval West, fewer large, stone-built for -
tifications meant fewer sieges. When sieges did take 
place the methods of attacking and defending were not 
especially sophisticated. Textual sources record soldiers 
charging at gates and defenders throwing stones at them, 
and only in a few instances, during the Carolingians’ con -
quest of Aquitaine for example, do they refer to the use 
of battering rams and stone throwers. 
The Byzantine Empire, by contrast, invested serious 
money in fortifications from the seventh century on -
ward and there were major Muslim sieges of Byzantine 
cities, including, famously, Constantinople in 717. 
NAVAL WARFARE 
The pax Romana in the Mediterranean meant that there had been little need for an imperial navy from the first 
century BC to to the third AD. With the fall of Italy, 
Spain and northern Africa to the Goths and the Vandals during the fifth century, however, naval warfare once 
more became important as the Romans endeavoured to 
bring these groups to heel, especially the Vandals. Our 
accounts of fifth- and sixth-century naval confrontations 
include the first references to light, easily manoeuvrable 
dromon boats, which were to become the mainstay of 
the Byzantine navy. Along the Rhine and Danube fron-
tiers, meanwhile, lighter vessels kept watch against Bar -
barian groups.Naval warfare assumed an even greater importance for 
the Byzantines once the Umayyads acquired a navy in 
the 650s. Great Byzantine-Umayyad naval battles were

able to cross the North Sea and navigate the waterways 
of Britain and the Carolingian Empire. The Anglo-Sax-

their own fleets to patrol coastlines and major rivers 
such as the Seine. "
"157 WARFARE IN EUROPE, AD 300–1000ESPRIT DE CORPS 
Prior to AD 300, the culture of the Roman armies had 
been predominantly pagan, with emperors, generals and 
soldiers sacrificing to the gods before military campaigns 
and battles. The Emperor Constantine’s conversion to 
Christianity in the early 310s thus introduced a major 
change to the Roman military esprit de corps. This began 
with his decision to have the cross painted on his sol-
diers’ shields and for his troops to carry banners embla-
zoned with the chi-rho symbol at the Battle of the Mil-
vian Bridge against Maxentius in 312. As Roman and 
post-Roman Europe was gradually Christianised across 
the fourth to sixth centuries, the new religion continued 
to imbue military culture. The popular belief in the 
supernatural intervention of saints in sieges at Thessa-
loniki (Greece) and Constantinople in the seventh cen-
tury sums up the powerful role of Christian belief in bol-
stering morale before battles and sieges by the end of 
Late Antiquity. 
The role of Christianity in military culture and morale 
intensified in the early-medieval period, when Carolin-
gian and Byzantine armies on campaign were regularly 
accompanied by priests. They were expected to conduct services and read prayers before battle. Political and mili-
tary leaders from Constantine to Charlemagne drew 
upon the image of the Old-Testament warrior kings. 
Another major change to fourth-century Roman mili-
tary culture was the emergence of a Roman-German 
frontier culture, especially in the West. The war cry 
known as barritus, dress accessories such as crossbow 
brooches, and other weaponry and equipment suggest the emergence of a military culture in frontier regions 
from the Rhine to the Black Sea, common to Roman 
frontier soldiers (many of whom were Germanic) and  
to some Barbarian groups beyond the frontiers. By the 
end of the West Roman Empire in 476, the military pro-GREEK FIRE

fession had come to be associated entirely with Franks  
or Goths in regions such as Gaul and Italy. 
From a cultural perspective, these Germanic troops  
were renowned for their courageous and sometimes  
rash charges in battle, as well as an ‘honour-and-shame’  
mentality. 
SUMMARY 
The period from 300 to 1000 witnessed a number of changes, including the movement from regular pitched 
battles to attrition warfare and raiding, and from large 
infantry armies to those including troops who could 
fight either on foot or on horseback. Meanwhile, with 
the exception of the West in the sixth to eighth centu-
ries, fortifications came to play a major role in defensive 
warfare in this period, especially in the Byzantine East. 
Finally, the end of the civil society and professional 
standing army of the West Roman Empire meant that 
armies came to be recruited via social ties between lead-
ers and aristocratic subjects in the Early Middle Ages. There were exceptions to some of these rules, however. 
The Byzantine Empire retained a professional standing 
army with a central recruitment and provisioning sys-
tem and by the tenth century had rediscovered tradi-
tional Late Roman approaches to training and battlefield 
tactics. 
Further attempts to categorise armies and peoples 
according to particular tactical specialisations have usu-
ally been disproved by scholars. Technologies remained 
fundamentally the same across this period and so did  
the majority of tactical approaches adopted by Roman, 
Frankish, Anglo-Saxon and Byzantine armies. These 
were usually determined by the nature of the terrain and 
opponents rather than by ‘ethnic’ identities. Late Roman 
military manuals such as Vegetius’ De re militari (fourth 
century) continued to be used throughout the period. From a cultural perspective, Christianity and a Germanic 
military ethos replaced Roman and pagan culture, espe-
cially in the West. Along with Roman Christian notions 
of just and holy war, these developments ultimately "

his famous parrot: it was to accompany 
him for twenty years and ‘could imitate 
people, dance, sing, swear, and much 
more.’ His pupil Hierocles wrote that 
Olympiodorus succeeded in binding 
many foreign peoples to the Roman 
Empire, so it would appear that his diplomacy was successful. 
Olympiodorus was a historiographer  
as well, and — apart from his parrot —  
it was his historical work that gained him the most renown. It comprised 
twenty-two books and was dedicated  
to Theodosius II. Unfortunately all that remains is a synopsis by Photius, patri  -

from Dalmatia (part of modern Croa -

through Pannonia (present-day west 
Hungary and parts of, among others, 
Austria and Croatia) to Greece, but 
accomplished nothing. Stilicho himself 
fell victim to intrigues by his Christian 
opponent Olympius, who accused him of conspiring against Honorius and planning to make his own son emperor. Stilicho and his son were tried and ex ecuted. A contemporary Greek his-

claims that the accusations against Stili -
cho really came from Olympiodorus himself.
Olympiodorus placed himself in the

AD 300–1000
Marco Mostert
If in Late Antiquity or the Early Middle Ages people 
needed or wanted to know something, to whom did 
they turn? Most people did not have access to written 
texts themselves, although practically everyone must 
have been aware of at least some of the things that those 
who were able to read and write could do with written 
texts. This state of affairs seems to have mattered little. 
Most people were engaged in agricultural work, and the 
knowledge necessary to grow crops or tend cattle was 
learned from experts without the need to consult books 
about these topics. The few works about agriculture that 
had been written in Antiquity, such as those by the Ro -
man authors Cato and Varro, had been all but forgotten, 
but their subject matter was known among farmers any -
way. Similarly, the production of goods, such as pottery or metalwork, went on without the assistance of written 
texts. If certain crafts — the art of the glazier, for in -
stance — seem to have been lost or forgotten in some 
regions, there had never been written texts that might 
have substituted for the practical knowledge that had 
been applied in the making of sheet glass.
CENTRES OF LEARNING AND  
THE ARTES LIBERALES
In towns and cities there were more opportunities to 
come into contact with writing. This happened because, after the gradual acceptance of Christianity and its becoming the Roman Empire’s official religion in the 
fourth century, these settlements (together with the 
monasteries, which could be found mainly in the coun-
tryside) became the main centres where this organised 
religion of the Book developed. But most people, in 
town and countryside alike, were content with a passive 
relationship with religious writing.Some of those who could read and write, and therefore 
were actively literate, developed an interest in know -
ledge and scholarship for its own sake. In Roman  Antiquity, a profound knowledge of literature had been 
expected of anyone taking part in the social life of the 
elites. This interest gradually dwindled, but the idea

those who had free time to devote to the pursuit of 
learning. They were mainly interested in the artes libe­
rales, the ‘arts of the free man’, which consisted  
of the ‘three ways’ (the trivium) of grammar, rhetoric 
and dialectic or logic, and the ‘four ways’ (quadrivium)  
of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy.The arts of the trivium were considered more important 
than those of the quadrivium, as they dealt with lan-guage and argumentation, and these were deemed indis -
pensable for the understanding of the Divine message 
that was incarnated in the words of what came to be 
known as the Bible. Even the study of the grammar and 
rhetoric of ancient, non-Christian authors was consid-
ered helpful to understand God’s message better —  
although there were always some who frowned upon this love of letters out of a desire for God. The artes  "
"164 CROSSROADS CONNECTIVITYliberales formed a prerequisite for the study of philoso-
phy and theology. Similarly, they provided a theoretical 
framework for the study of medicine (which some 
ninth-century authors called ‘the eighth art’). This de -
velopment might have surprised the literate elites of 
Antiquity, who would have been inclined to consider 
medicine as one of the ‘mechanical arts’ (artes mechani­
cae). They allowed engineers to overcome the imper -
fections of nature itself by producing marvellous works, but this kind of business had not been considered fit to occupy the leisure of the Roman elites. This disregard  
for getting one’s hands dirty, associated with what we 
would now call the applied sciences, was to disappear 
only very slowly. In our period there were nevertheless 
some advances in the sciences, for instance in astron-
omy, based on direct observation, and in medicine, 
mainly, it seems, in the knowledge of medicinal herbs.
THE PRACTICE OF WRITING
In the fields of scholarship and science, knowledge of  the ways in which written texts were produced and used 
was a requirement. Some important developments took 
place in the material forms of writing. Most writing was 
done on wax tablets. Small wooden or ivory hollowed 
planks were filled with coloured wax. When depressed 
with a metal stylus, the wax changes its colour towards 
white. In this way one can write short messages quite 
cheaply. The message could be effaced by rubbing the 
text with the opposite, round end of the stylus. Late 
Antique and early-medieval styluses are found almost 
everywhere in Europe nowadays, thanks to the use of 
metal detectors by archaeologists. Tiny lead bullets 
showing the imprints of the cords with which sets of 
wax tablets were closed to shield their contents from 
prying eyes are also found; these objects were very 
unlikely to be noticed in the days before the metal detec-
tor. Other inexpensive surfaces on which one could 
write were wooden twigs (used for runes and rune-like 
inscriptions) and shards of pottery.
FROM ROLL TO CODEX
For longer texts, however, different forms were used.  In Antiquity rolls of leaves of papyrus glued together, or 
of leaves of parchment sown together, were commonly 
used. They could hold, for instance, part of a long literary 
work, often known as a ‘book’. To make a single copy of a 
work consisting of, say, twenty such ‘books’ would have 
caused practical problems whenever one wanted to look 
up a particular passage, as it would have necessitated 
unwinding a considerable number of pages. For this  
reason the rolls of Antiquity were usually rather small. 
The practical problem posed by consulting texts copied 
on rolls was solved by the introduction of the codex: the 
book as we still know it today, with a number of folded 
sheets, sown at the back, cut open on the outside, and 
held between two covers. Such a codex, especially when 
it was made of larger sheets of parchment, could easily UTRECHT PSALTER

contain voluminous works that before had needed a 
number of rolls. A census of surviving rolls and codices 
from Egypt containing texts in Greek shows that from 
the turn of the fourth century onwards the percentage of 
codices is just behind that of the rolls; by the fifth cen-
tury 90 per cent of the surviving texts comes from codi-
ces. This astonishing rise in the number of codices prob-
ably has something to do with the Christian texts that 
were copied in ever greater numbers: fragments from Bibles were much more likely to come from codices than 
from rolls.

Be this as it may, the change from roll to codex was to have profound consequences for scholarly reading habits 
in general. To read a roll suggested reading the text

"CROSSROADS DIVERSITY166ISIDORE OF SEVILLE
Pedro Castillo Maldonado
St Isidore, canonised in 1 598,  
was renowned most of all for his encyclopedic knowledge — which in modern times has made him  the patron saint of the Internet — , 
but he was also highly influential  in other fields. Isidore, bishop of Seville from 601 to 636, came from an aristocratic Hispano-Ro -
man family and played a leading role in the cultural blossoming in Visigothic Iberia in the seventh century. He is best known for  his hugely important work of com -
piling ancient knowledge, saving  classical texts for posterity while  filtering them for Christian use.  His magnum opus, the Etymolo­giae , served as an encyclopedic 
guide throughout the Middle Ages; his Sententiae  became the spiritual 
vade-mecum of medieval monas-teries. We are mistaken however  if we see Isidore as an intellectual locked in his ivory tower. He pro -
moted monachism through diverse foundations and by writing a mo -
nastic rule; he normalised educa -tion in monastic and episcopal schools, ending the ignorance that had reigned in Hispanic churches following decades of disorder and  coexistence with Gothic Arianism. Isidore was a man of his time and fully committed to defeating Arian -
ism; he was a friend and counsellor of kings and was involved in poli -
tics. It has rightly been said that  he exercised a tutelage over the kingdom. At the Fourth Council of Toledo (633) Isidore attempted to regu -
larise a dynastic-type monarchic succession, in exchange for the crown’s recognition of a habeas corpus  that would protect aristo -
crats and the clergy. At the same time, he formulated a political  theology in which the king would act as a pastor in the interests of Church and kingdom. This was  the culmination of the Visigothic state and the pact between monar -
chy and Church that made it up.  Miniature depicting St Isidore, from the 1 2th-cent. Aberdeen  Bestiary (encyclopedia of animals).
all the words until you found the words you were look -
ing for. If you wanted to look up the same passage in a 
codex, provided you remembered roughly where in the 
codex you read the passage before, you could simply skip 
to a page in the codex close to where you remembered 
the requested words to be. This meant that the form of 
the text in the codex no longer suggested reading from 
cover to cover. When texts had first been written down, 
the assumption had been that reading a text was more or 
less the same as listening to that text when it had been 
spoken out loud. Just as you could only hear a text by  
listening to every word, so you would need to read every 
word of the written text. By the fourth century AD, sev -
eral ways had already been devised to divide long texts into books, and those books into shorter sections. In a 
time when every copy of a text was written by hand, and 
every scribe made mistakes, some copies were better than others. Some colophons of the great works of clas-
sical literature state quite plainly that someone went to 
the trouble of counting the verses, so that the buyer 
knew he or she had a complete copy of the text. These 
colophons sometimes survived, because early-medieval 
scribes copied them into their codices together with the 
preceding work. If such care was taken over literary 
works already in Antiquity, how much more care would 
be taken to check copies of Bible books later on, when a 
mistake in the biblical text was considered a possible 
source of heresy, and heresy was considered an abomina-
tion by the Church authorities?
THE TROUBLE WITH LATIN
The possibility of reading only part of a text, suggested by the recent innovation that was the codex, was accom-
panied by changes in which the very words of the lan-"
"167 KNOWLEDGE, SCHOLARSHIP AND SCIENCE IN EUROPE, AD 300–1000guage were written down on the page. In the fourth  
century it had been customary to write without word 
sep  aration: thewordsmakingupasentencepresent-
edthemselvesinthisway. This ‘continuous writing’ 
required many eye movements from left to right and 
back again on the part of the reader, even if that reader 
was reading a text written in his or her mother tongue. 
He or she had to ‘pick’ meaningful sequences of letters 
out of the line; indeed, the Latin word for ‘reading’, 
legere, also meant ‘picking flowers’. With continuous 
writing you are forced to read a text from beginning to 
end — unless you already knew the text well before you 
started to look for particular words. Imagine the quite different plight of a non-native reader of Latin. Christi-
anity, a religion of the book, required serious students to 
be able to read that book. But the language of the Bible 
was not always that of one’s mother tongue. Learning to 
read therefore meant learning another language as well. 
Even those who considered themselves to speak one of 
the languages into which the Bible had been translated  
 — or indeed had been written, as was the case with the 
Greek New Testament — noticed in time that their lan-
guage had been developing away from that of their sacred book. The non-Romance-speakers on the British 
Isles found a solution in writing Latin texts with word 
separation, allowing them to distinguish at a glance what 
the Latin words looked like. By about the year 1000 the 
inhabitants of northern and central France, whose 
mother tongue had become ever more unlike the Latin 
from which it had developed, also needed to copy the 
Latin texts they were interested in with word separation.
A PRECIOUS RESOURCE
We should stress, however, that access to written books was restricted, and that therefore access to the books of 
scholarly and scientific knowledge, too, was limited in 
practice to monks and secular clergy, and, as far as the 
laity was concerned, to royalty and nobility. This is not 
to say that there was no literacy outside these circles. Far 
from it: recent research has suggested that reading and 
writing went on even in the countryside, and that every -
one came into contact with written texts. But access to books was another matter, and access to scholarly books 
was even rarer. That had to do, among other things, with 
the cost of books. Because brittle papyrus proved less 
durable outside the Mediterranean area, the writing sup-
port of choice was parchment. Parchment was made of 
the skins of animals, of cows, goats or sheep, and those skins came at a price, not to mention the fact that the preparation of parchment was labour-intensive.  
A one-volume Bible needed the skins of a sizeable flock 
of sheep, and smaller volumes still represented consider -
able investments. The early-medieval manuscripts that have come down to us all represent considered decisions 
to make a copy of a text or a collection of texts, or to 
write a text of some length. That is why every manu-
script book from our period is worth studying.
BOOK PRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL
We have fairly good evidence about the numbers of books surviving from AD 300–1000, at least as far as 
those from Latin-writing Europe are concerned. They 
even allow us to calculate the numbers that were pro-
duced. From the sixth through the eighth century some 
67,000 manuscripts were produced in the Latin West; 
this number dramatically increases in the ninth century, 
when over 200,000 manuscripts were produced. The 
number decreases to an estimated 136,000 manuscripts 
for the tenth century. Needless to say, only a fraction of 
these manuscripts has survived. From the entire eighth 
century, for instance, less than 2,000 manuscripts (or 
fragments of manuscripts) have survived. The surviving 
manuscripts for AD 300–1000, even if manuscripts con-
taining texts which we might consider scholarly or sci-
entific are a minority, nevertheless allow us to arrive at a 
general image of the interests of Late Antique and early-
medieval scholars.
Not all manuscripts had the same chance of survival.  
We may assume that deluxe, lavishly illuminated manu-
scripts were well taken care of, and that their survival 
rate is therefore above average. These manuscripts tend to contain Bible books. The manuscripts used by local 
clergy, on the contrary, had a very low survival rate. 
These books were used on a daily basis, they were sub-
ject to wear and tear and needed to be replaced when 
they were destroyed through use. Scholars’ manuscripts 
have their place somewhere between these extremes, 
their survival being determined by the care taken by  
the librarians of the institutions they served. Surprising 
numbers of them have come down to us, especially from 
the ninth- and tenth-century West.
THE CLASSICAL AND CHRISTIAN TRADITIONS
As far as their contents are concerned, the surviving 
manuscripts mainly belong to the two intertwined  
traditions we have encountered above. They may con-"
""
"169 KNOWLEDGE, SCHOLARSHIP AND SCIENCE IN EUROPE, AD 300–1000tain texts that have their place in the written tradition  
of Antiquity, with copies of the classical authors, com-
mentaries on these authors, and other secondary texts. 
Whereas these non-Christian texts were read mainly  
for the quality of their Latin, their contents were not ne -
glected either. Of some 1,700 manuscripts of the Latin 
classics that are of interest for reconstructing the textual 
tradition, no less than 440 date from the ninth and tenth 
centuries. It is certain that without the interest taken by 
the early-medieval monks who copied the classics, our 
knowledge of the ancient world would be much the 
poorer. The second written tradition is that of Christian-
ity itself, starting in Antiquity and continuing and devel-
oping to the end of our period and beyond. This tradi-
tion starts with the epistles of St Paul, develops in the 
various Churches in Greece, Rome, the Middle East and 
northern Africa, and spreads in Europe wherever and 
whenever Christianity gets a foothold. Translations and 
adaptations from one language and cultural tradition to 
another were taking place already before the start of our 
period and have continued until the present. To these 
two main traditions we should add the original texts written in Europe between 300 and 1000. Although 
they may speak less to the imagination than some earlier 
and later scholarly and scientific texts, they bear witness 
to a continuous interest in knowledge for its own sake. 
One of the main sources for early-medieval inquisitive-
ness can be found in the margins of the manuscripts. 
There, readers engaged in conversation not only with 
the texts they found, but also with one another, one 
reader replying with his own marginal annotation to an 
observation by an earlier reader on the manuscript’s 
original text. This marginal scholarship shows, some-
times better than the scholarship of contemporary com-plete works, the acumen and versatility of those scholars 
without whose work many of the insights of Antiquity 
would have been lost forever, and the intellectual foun-
dation of science as it developed in the later Middle Ages 
and in Early Modern times would have been significantly 
different. 
THE BYZANTINE AND THE ISLAMIC EAST
So far we have looked mainly at those parts of Europe in which Latin was the most important language for the 
transmission of knowledge. The situation in the Byzan-
tine East, where Greek was the main language of science 
and scholarship, and that in the Islamic East, where Ara-
bic played that role, at a first glance was not all that dif-
ferent. In the Islamic world, paper, which had come to 
the Middle East by way of the silk roads, was used for 
writing by the middle of the eighth century: far earlier 
than in the Byzantine Empire or Latin Europe, where it 
became current from the twelfth century onwards. But if 
we move away from the materialities of written culture 
to the notions of scholarship, science, and knowledge, 
these show remarkable similarities in the three civilisa-
tions concerned. The Byzantine intellectual copied, pos-
sessed, read, studied, and annotated both theological and 
secular books, as one may see in the Library of Photius, a 
ninth-century patriarch of Constantinople. This work is 
a collection of 279 reviews of books he had read. But, just 
as in the contemporary West, the theological works eas-
ily outnumbered the secular ones. The book culture of 
ninth-century Baghdad is rightly famous for the transla-tions into Arabic of a wide selection of the works of 
Greek Antiquity. In Late Antiquity, Greek works were 
translated into Syriac. Then they were translated directly 
from the Greek into Arabic, mainly through the service 
of Syriac Christians, with some input from Jewish and 
Zoroastrian scholars. Muslim scholarship seems to have 
been mainly interested in philosophy and science. One 
of the best translators was Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809–873), 
who knew Arabic, Persian, Greek, and Syriac. He foun-
ded a school of translators at Baghdad, where Christians 
gathered to read their literature. He also looked for 
Greek manuscripts in Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and 
Egypt. Not all Muslims were interested in Greek texts, 
however, and Hunayn often complains about  
the bad state of the manuscripts he managed to find.

as the Abbasid translation movement), most hubs of 
knowledge were religious in inspiration, with monastic ABBASID LIBRARY

were being translated into Arabic."
"171 KNOWLEDGE, SCHOLARSHIP AND SCIENCE IN EUROPE, AD 300–1000THE NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE
Most knowledge was bookish, based as it was on written 
texts and their interpretation. From the seventeenth 
century we have become used to considering science a 
systematic enterprise that builds and organises knowl-
edge in the form of testable explanations of and predic-
tions about the universe. Religious knowledge, impor -
tant to all three civilisations in AD 300–1000, hardly plays any role in modern science. For this reason we will 
not find any reference to important discoveries made 
during this period in modern surveys of science. This 
does not mean, however, that reasoning on the basis  
of observation did not take place, as can be seen in the 
illustrations of the Byzantine version of Dioscorides (see 
p. 165) or the calculations of the tides by the Venerable 
Bede (eighth century). Religious knowledge, however, 
was far more important; the ways of acquiring it, for in -
stance by distinguishing layers of meaning in authorita-
tive texts (literal, allegorical, moral and eschatological) 
are so different from modern ways of interpreting texts 
that most of the greatest scholars of the period have been 
forgotten.
LITERATURE
We encounter similar problems when we want to appre-
ciate the literary texts produced. First of all, we tend to 
forget that, apart from Latin, Greek and Arabic writings, 
there were considerable collections of literary texts that 
were either written in other languages or lived in the 
memory of their performers only. Apart from a substan-
tial literature in Greek the Byzantine world knew literary 
works in Latin, Syriac, Coptic, Armenian, Georgian, and 
Old Church Slavonic. Yet these literatures do not nor -
mally find a place in discussions of ‘Byzantine’ literature, which consider mainly works in Greek. This has more to 
do with our modern notion of ‘literature’, which tends 
to privilege those works written in the vernaculars that 
‘liberated’ themselves from the shackles of, for instance, 
written Latin, than with a consideration of the written 
languages in use in those areas where written Latin (or 
Greek, or Arabic) had most authority. This easily leads to 
a view in which literature written in the languages that 
can be shown to have been the ancestors of our modern 
vernaculars is considered far more valuable than the 
equally rich literary works that were written at the same 
time and in much larger quantities in Latin, Greek and Arabic — except of course where Greek and Arabic are 
considered the forebears of the current vernaculars. This explains why one survey of literary texts through the 
ages mentions a mere sixty-seven works from our 
pe riod, of which thirty are in Latin, Arabic or Greek;  
the rest concerns the first texts of literary interest in six mainly Western vernaculars. This disregards the huge 
amounts of writing in Latin, Greek and Arabic, in which 
far more texts were written that we would still consider ‘literary’ — not to mention the huge numbers of other 
works, many of which would have been considered ‘lit-erature’ by contemporaries even if we have stopped 
doing so.
This is why it is so difficult to answer questions as to 
who the most important scholars were, which topics 
they discussed, where the hubs of knowledge were. And 
also, as far as the matter of literature is concerned, why 
developments in the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim 
world are almost always treated in a stepmotherly fash-
ion. It is difficult to embrace these three civilisations at 
the same time; in order to arrive at even an approximate 
view of knowledge, scholarship, and science in AD 300–
1000, this is nevertheless what we have to attempt."
"172 CROSSROADS CONNECTIVITYIn 4 1 6–4 1 8 Paulus Orosius, who  
had come from what is now Braga in 
Portugal to Africa in 4 1 4, wrote the first 
Christian universal history (in Latin), 
entitled History against the Pagans. In 
it, he attempted to describe the suffer -
ing of mankind from the fall of Adam and Eve to the present. He wrote this work on the suggestion of St Augustine, 
who had requested a historiographical 
addendum to his own The City of God 
against the Pagans, on which he had 
started work in 4 1 3. Orosius answered 
with a work in seven books, which was to prove hugely popular in the Middle 
Ages. When King Alfred the Great of 
Wessex (r. 871–899) decided on an  
education programme with transla -
tions of the main Latin works into Eng -
lish, he included Orosius’ text.
Orosius had started his first book with 
a short geographical description of the ‘known world’, to set the stage for his 
story of human suffering. He described 
a world centred on the Roman Empire, 
around the Mediterranean. At the end 
of the ninth century, however, areas that 
had been on the empire’s edge and beyond were known to Alfred and his translators as well. These northern 
regions, they decided, needed to be described as well. Alfred therefore 
included two reports on voyages north. 
One was by Ohthere, who had set out  
to find out how far the northernmost 
lands inhabited by the Norse stretched 
to the north. The other was by Wulfstan, 
who gave an account of the Baltic.
Ohthere, who claimed ‘that he lived  
farthest to the north of all the Norwe -
gians,’ reached the White Sea. He told 
the king that from his home, in the pre -

AND SHIFTING  
ATTITUDES  
IN MEDIEVAL 
EUROPE
Lynda Mulvin
Medieval identity as a concept is difficult to define. 
While the notion of individuality can be observed in the 
medieval sources and in terms of art and representation, 
identity in the Middle Ages differs from the modern 
concept. Overall, the concept is complex to elucidate.
We do know that in the Early Middle Ages there existed 
a core of shared values that we can call ‘identity’. These 
were based on a shared history that coalesced to create  
a vast and culturally rich society. What we consider cul-
tural diversity in this period was stimulated by a sense  
of belonging to a specific society with a distinctive mate-
rial culture. It includes forming a sense of attachment to 
a place, which led to participation in civic life as part of a 
collective identity of people who shared similar ideals. 
All of this happened within changing environments  
and social structures as urban life crystallised. Despite 
the complexity we can gather clues as to how people 
represented, understood and saw themselves through 
the art, texts, and scholarship that they produced. 
People shared identity through commonality — creating 
connections and ties across medieval communities. That said, distinctive identities were also anchored in place and space, as patterns of behaviour were transmitted in  
a group and handed down through generations. A neces-
sarily complex issue, identity must take into account  
relevant issues such as topography, religious change, ORPHEUS
The motif of Orpheus, the mythical 
musician enchanting animals, was common in Graeco-Roman Antiqui ty. As early as the late 2nd 
century Orpheus was re-interpret -
ed as Christ saving his flock with his tea  chings. In the Early Middle 
Ages, mythological statuary was considered appropriate decoration 
since classical education remained relevant to municipal upper class-es. Mythological figures were con -
sidered an important mark of sta -

"175 IDENTITY AND SHIFTING ATTITUDES IN MEDIEVAL EUROPEmaterial culture, art, architecture, and infrastructure to 
understand the formation of European cultural heritage. 
Abstract theoretical approaches to the subject of identity 
have affected debates on how medieval social and eco-
nomic structures evolved. 
Traditionally, identification of people has taken root in 
the forms of art that they create. Representation of iden-
tity in the European discourse crosses over several major 
art movements and regional art genres to inform the 
pro  cess of establishing European nationhood. During 
and following the Roman Empire, individual regions created a unique artistic identity. This developed out of 
artistic heritage and iconographic modes from Rome and 
the early Church, playing on classical art and traditions 
of realism and expressionism. In the Migration Period, 
more varied cultural forms emerged, ranging from the 
distinctive Visigothic, Merovingian, Longobardic, Slavic 
and Avar to Insular, Norse, Carolingian and pre-Roman-
esque designs. From the East, Byzantine cultural style 
was gradually transmitted to Italy. This period saw a 
truly diverse range of artistic styles and expressions; the 
building projects of the Emperor Justinian (r. 527–565) at Ravenna and Islamic artistic endeavours in Spain created 
innovative possibilities in emerging new canons of art 
and architecture. It is on these early-medieval expres-
sions that many modern identities are based. 
SOCIETY AND SOCIAL STRUCTURES
The period from AD 300 to 1000 saw a transformation 
from tribal communities to a more general society, in 
many cases united by economic life and under the same 
rule of law. However, it is difficult to estimate medieval 
populations. Studies have suggested an increase from  
27 million to 37 million people over the whole continent 
by AD 1000, spreading across coastal regions and more 
densely concentrated in towns and cities. The growth  
of urban life in post-Roman cities is well documented 
with centres developing around court culture, connected 
by the Roman road network. In these centres, new archi-
tecture and design came into their own, as can be seen in 
the monastic settlements that were no less than early  
cities, built from scratch in rural areas. 
We have come to think that medieval Europe emerged 
from a fragmentation of the Western Roman Empire  
and what was known as ‘the Other’ area or barbaricum: 
present-day Ireland, Britain and Scandinavia, free Ger -
mania Magna and the Slavic world. The feudal society that we associate with the Middle 
Ages gains its first feet in this period. The feudal system 
differed from ‘Barbarian society’ (and earlier tribal socie-
ties) through the procuring of immense holdings by  
the rising nobility and the Church on the one hand and 
small holdings of peasants and artisans on the other, cre-
ating a world view based on an agrarian society. 
Despite these changes, Rome’s heritage was not aban-
doned. As the power base was shifted away from Rome 
and Constantinople founded in AD 324 on the existing 
city of Byzantium, the new capital became a new Rome, Nova Roma, as the inheritor of Roman tradition in the 
East. The Byzantine Empire and its heartland, Greece, 
played a crucial role in the development of identity as 
the Eastern empire inherited an unbroken classical cul-
tural tradition. During the reign of the Byzantine em -
peror Justinian, the Byzantine Empire reached into Italy 
and across to Spain. Byzantine cultural heritage was 
characterised by three main tenets: continuity of classical 
Greek culture, the heritage of Rome and the rule of Ro -
man law, and the promotion of the Christian faith.SYRIAN YOUTH

Mapping has always been a tool to find one’s way as well 
as a tool to define one’s place. In the Early Middle Ages, 
making maps was a means of physical expression of the 
urban and rural landscape. Mapping emphasised one’s 
place in the world and stimulated thoughts about the 
surrounding environment, including the shape of the 
world itself. While plotting the landscape, the map also 
solidified people’s place: the borders clarified where —  
and who — you were in relation to the rest of the world. 
Mapping did by no means begin in the early-medieval 
period. The Greek geographer Claudius Ptolemy’s Geo ­
graphia (second century AD) mapped coordinates of  
the Graeco-Roman world from Byzantium to the remote 
coasts of Britannia and Hibernia (Ireland) — showing  
the vast bounds of what could be considered Roman. Additionally, once space was defined, a person could 
more easily move through it. A Late Roman route map, 
the Tabula Peutingeriana (fourth century, thirteenth- 
century copy), presented itineraries for use by pilgrims 
and merchants alike to travel from West to East, from 
Augusta Treverorum (now Trier, Germany) to Rome to 
Constantinople and Jerusalem. "
"177 IDENTITY AND SHIFTING ATTITUDES IN MEDIEVAL EUROPEPSALM TEXT PRESERVED 
IN A BOG
The Springmount Bog Wax Tablets 
were found four feet deep in a peat bog in County Antrim, Ireland. Dat -
ing from c. AD 600, they constitute the earliest known example of Latin writing in Ireland. The six tablets were tied together in a package and contain the text of Psalms 30–32; they may have been used in  the teaching of the Psalms or for  instruction in writing. Wax tablets are a rare find in Northern Europe due to its wet climate; these were preserved thanks to the bog in which a travelling priest may have lost them.
The Venerable Bede (673–735) provides much informa-
tion on how early-medieval Europe bounded itself. He 
describes the shape and makeup of the world, pointing 
out borders and naming groups and their origins. He 
mentions Germany, France and Spain — the greater part 
of Europe — and outlines the composition of Britain as 
containing five nations: the Angles, Britons, Scots, Picts, 
and Latins. He indicates the populations who came from 
the Low Countries and Denmark to the coastal regions 
of the British Isles as Saxons, Angles, and Jutes. Other 
early-medieval historians such as St Isidore of Seville 
(c.560–636) contemplated the shape and makeup of the 
world. He speaks of ‘the round earth washed on all sides 
by oceans’ and drew the famous simple T map (see p. 6). 
From maps, we can see a changing sense of place and 
identity for early-medieval Europeans. Their world orig-
inally had Rome at its centre, with clear distinctions be -
tween Britannia at the top and Ireland to the right, with 
internal ethnographic divisions of Scotland and Wales, for instance. The later map of the Anglo-Norman cam-
paigner Gerald of Wales (c.1146–c.1223), however, would 
look different. 
The Early Middle Ages were a period of migration,  
the effect of which was felt. From the source material, 
though, we can see how Christianity had a unifying ef -
fect; Bede refers to ‘faith and piety bestowed on pagan 
Alba, casting off the darkness of idolatry’ as the Irish 
bishop Palladius ‘sent to the Scots believing in Christ  
in AD 431.’ They may have been new people from un -
fam iliar territory, but what was important — at least to 
Bede — was the unifying power of the Christian faith. 
NATION BUILDING, SCHOLARSHIP

AD 800), found in a peat bog in County Tipperary in 2006, shows a combination of Germanic animal ornament and Christian symbols.

yond the borders. As previously discussed, this idea  
re-emerged during the Middle Ages, in part due to the re-
emergence of Roman models of behaviour and structure.
In the fourth century AD, land survey, property and cen-
sus were formalised with the imperial Forma urbis map 
which documented streets, title and ownership of prop-
erty in the city of Rome. The Roman hierarchy of father 
and family, with the pater familias passing the inheri-
tance to his sons, was the embodiment of patriarchal 
ideology connected to property, as ownership denoted 
the status of Roman citizens. 
One change to this that occurred in the Early Middle 
Ages is due to religious change. As Christianity took hold "
"179 IDENTITY AND SHIFTING ATTITUDES IN MEDIEVAL EUROPEin Rome, wealth and property flowed towards the grow -
ing Church. Even further in the future, the feudal system 
would build on this idea and direct human behaviour in  
a similar way. The social structure surrounding wealth would be dependent on a relationship with agrarian so -
ciety aimed at defending the life of the individual and 
wealth was distributed as due recompense. 
Despite the changing reality of the social structures, 
much of the early identity discourse centres on the con-
cept of Rome: the structures, power, and ways of con-
structing the self. As early as the first century AD, the 
Roman historiographer Tacitus reflects on nationhood 
by describing the tribes of Germania. He notes that they 
are governed by kings whose power derives from Roman 
authority. On the other hand, Britannic tribes were con-
trasted to Roman citizens. The symbolic power of Rome 
and the Roman Empire pervaded political ideology for 
many centuries (see below regarding Charlemagne). 
In the Early Middle Ages, the power of the Church was 
assertive in the realm of the preservation of Roman  
tradition, which would be a unifying cultural factor for 
Western Christendom, and enshrine Roman law. 
Religious codes and rules also served to establish tradi-
tions and ideology. One such example is the well-known 
Rule of St Benedict (c.480–543) of Nursia. Such monastic 
rules were not isolated from political changes. Pope 
Gregory the Great (pope 590–604) created a political 
vision for the papacy, while the sixth-century St Greg-
ory of Tours in his History of the Franks used loaded  
language by describing the Eastern Roman Empire as a 
republic. And, most notably, in a political gesture, Pope 
Leo III (pope 795–816) crowned Charlemagne ‘emperor 
of the Romans’ in Rome on Christmas Day 800. This act 
revived connections between emperor and state religion that had existed in the Roman period. From here on -
ward, being emperor meant supporting the Church. 
As emperor, Charlemagne constructed a royal chapel at 
Aachen that was closely modelled on Justinian’s build-
ing programme — including the Byzantine Basilica of  
San Vitale at Ravenna (547), the Byzantine architecture of Sts Sergius and Bacchus (527), and the Hagia Sophia  
at Constantinople (537). This visual modelling made ref-
erence to the Great Byzantine court, reinforcing Charle-magne’s identity as emperor and the identity of his king-
dom as an empire to rival the established Byzantine 
Empire. His empire lasted, and by the tenth century  
the Ottonian dynasty would firmly entrench the Holy 
‘Roman’ Empire as the dynastic organ of succession and the power base for defenders of Christianity in western 
Europe.
The time when Charlemagne lived — the eighth cen-
tury — was a time of many changes, which were 
recorded by historians. This period is known for its ren ­
ovatio or revival of Roman culture and learning. From contem  porary texts we can get closer to a sense of how 
people identified themselves and others. 
Einhard’s Vita Karoli Magni (Life of Charlemagne, c.830), 
for instance, describes the Anglo-Saxons and Scandina-
vian tribes as ‘Barbarians’ –meaning that they lived be -
yond ‘Christian lands’. Understandably, these texts  
are not unbiased — many had political implications. The 
second book of Widukind’s Res gestae Saxonicae (Deeds of the Saxons, c.960) was dedicated to Matilda, abbess  
of Quedlinburg (955–999), Otto I’s daughter. She played  
an important role in the empire’s affairs, and is treated  as such. Widukind writes: ‘For you are rightly recognised 
as the mistress of all Europe, although the power of  
your father has now extended to Africa and Asia.’ 
Not all the writing and identity building came from 
Latin-language lives and histories. We have evidence of 
vernacular literature, which may have come from earlier 
oral traditions. Early examples come from Ireland to 
Europe in the form of Ogham script, a system of linear 
symbols. Although Latin became the official language, 
the Gaelic language (in the case of Ireland) remained 
important to the culture, as it does to this day. It is  possible that this was the same throughout Europe.
Literacy was an important way of expressing identity 
and power. Illuminated manuscripts — such as the 
Faddan More Psalter (book of Psalms) — were a corner -
stone of the Christian mission, spreading literacy 
throughout Europe. Medieval texts chronicle the lives  
of saints and kings, but also the lives of the less-known. 
On the whole, these texts served to connect the individ-
ual to a world view, forming an identity through rela-
tionships to story and text. 
Another form of learning came from the Church and 
affected medieval man’s view of his own place in the 
world. Boethius (sixth century AD) wrote of a ‘rational 
and indivisible substance’ from which man was made  
to reflect God. This form of individual in the image of 
God was a further spiritual self-affirmation of the hu -
man soul. These theological teachings influenced the 
structure of the early-medieval world view. Another 
example comes from Pseudo-Dionysius, a sixth-century 
Byzantine theologian. He used Neo-Platonic philosophy "
"180 CROSSROADS CONNECTIVITYto give his theological teachings a mystical character and 
his world view included a hierarchy of angels, institu-
tions and men. This text was translated into Latin, and  
in the ninth century the Irish theologian John Scotus 
Eriugena called this the ‘angelic hierarchy’. This devel-
opment in world view would later be regarded as an 
ideological justification for feudalism. 
Furthermore, in this period Marian theology emerged, 
which served to unify worship in both East and West, 
and further promoted a hierarchy of the universe. It also 
placed an emphasis on women, as the portraits of the 
Virgin attempted to capture the soul of women as an 
innate part of medieval identity. Personal devotion how -
ever also affected social relations. This can be seen in the icon, which would remain popular and central to belief 
even after the Byzantine iconoclasm (see the contribu-
tion of Dellaporta, Bormpoudaki and Pianalto). 
DIPLOMACY AND DIVERSITY
As in the courtly realm, social structures had an impact 
on foreign affairs. At the level of the Byzantine elite,  
diplomatic embassies were dispatched to foreign  
courts with gifts. This spectacle and tradition has been 
described in detail by Liudprand of Cremona (c.920–
972), a Longobard diplomat and historian who in 949 
travelled to Constantinople at his own expense. This 
source is invaluable, and we learn about many things, 
including his opportunity to learn Greek. His mission was an unprecedented success, received by the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus. Liudprand was impressed 
with Byzantine hospitality and marvelled at the sights, 
including a gold tree with mechanical songbirds. He 
must have died on the Bosporus during his second mis-
sion to Constantinople. 
Diplomacy was only one of the ways that led to unifica-
tion. West and East united further in the last quarter of 
the tenth century with the dynastic marriage between 
the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II (r. 973–983) and the 
Byzantine princess Theophano in 971. Liudprand’s Rela­
tio de legatione Constantinopolitana tells of his second 
embassy (968) and describes the bustling city of Con-
stantinople with its many migrants: ‘Italians, Saxons, 
Bavarians, Franks, Swabians, Greeks and Hungarians.’ 
Evidence of diplomatic ceremonies is important for our 
understanding of identity; social norms were established 
by handing down the customs and mores described. 
Of course, diplomacy and attempts at unification speak 
to the diversity that was apparent in this period. Peoples 
of Europe have been identified historically as Celts, 
Franks, Saxons, Alemanni, Longobards, Avars, Byzan-
tines and Umayyads (in Spain). The latter provide a 
unique look at early-medieval multicultural society:  
the Muslim presence can be seen in objects with an 
Andalusian flavour, whereas carved ivory caskets and 
other objects demonstrated an adoption of Muslim 
themes by Jewish and Christian patrons. On the other COPYCAT FASHION

to the Byzantine iconoclastic controversy. During the 
eighth to ninth centuries, images in the East were de -
stroyed — an upheaval that limits the artistic evidence 
from this period, and widened the divergence between Eastern and Western traditions in the Church. 
Travel was an important factor in early-medieval culture, 
not only for diplomatic reasons. Pilgrimage to holy cities 
as a means to salvation — from Ireland to Rome, Con-
stantinople and Jerusalem — emerged and increased. 
From the tenth century Santiago de Compostela became 
an important centre. Here transient communities bound 
together like families. The eyewitness account in the 
Liber Sancti Jacobi (Book of St James, c.1130) describes 
tribes gathered at the portico of St James as Germans, 
Franks and Italians. A side effect of pilgrimage is a shift-
ing perception of the world; communities learned about 
different places, which stimulated interest in different 
nations, nationhood, and diversity. 
CONCLUSIONS
The medieval view of the universe on the one hand tended to reinforce existing opinions, while on the other 
hand it went well beyond defined cultural and existential 
borders. The effects of travel to foreign lands and migra-
tion were felt in the changes in art, literature, and culture.
A significant part of each regional identity was con-structed in contrast to those ‘of another identity’. While notions of distinctiveness during the medieval period 
were tenuous, art and representation helped to shape 
both the public and the private domain. Works of art, 
which serve as repositories of memory, are a vital source 
of knowledge on medieval ideologies.
Furthermore, mapping and scholarship added to the 
changing sense of the world. These contributed to the realisation of space, time and physical boundaries and 
their relationship. They affected the transfer of know -
ledge as people came into increasing contact, and led to identification of distinct and diverse peoples. This defin-
ing of geopolitical realms — and the increased individual 
world view — would forge new connections in terms  
of European identity across the landscape of the Early 
Middle Ages."

"184INTRODUCTION
Lindsay Morehouse
The previous chapters have already explored the distinctive 
groups that inhabited the early-medieval world, and have re-
examined the networks through which they interacted. These 
chapters paint a picture of a vibrant, diverse, and above all 
complex world. Nonetheless, the history of the early-medie -
val period has not always been viewed in this way.  Jerome (later known as St Jerome) experienced the capture 
of Rome in the fifth century first-hand. Understandably dis-traught by the events that he had witnessed, he commented 
that the capture had extinguished a brightness in the world. 
Although Jerome was reacting to events in his own time,  
the view of this period as a lightless time — a ‘Dark Age’ —  
largely persists because of later writers who wished to con -
trast the Early Middle Ages with the ‘Golden Age’ of the 
Roman Empire. This view, of course, ignores the vibrant 
world of the Eastern Roman Empire ruled from Constantino -
ple that existed at this same time. It is Petrarch, writing in the 
1 330s about the perceived decline of the Latin language in 
the West, who is largely credited with the creation of the 
‘Dark Ages’ rhetoric. Later writers would also use the term to 
contrast the West in the Early Middle Ages with the Renais-
sance: a ‘Golden Age’ when classical scholarship returned to 
western Europe. Edward Gibbon solidified this view in his 
seminal work The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1 77 6), in which he argues that the Early 
Middle Ages destroyed human greatness. 
These few examples show that the Early Middle Ages have 
long been viewed as a time when all ingenuity — including 
art, knowledge, and infrastructure — was lost from Europe. 
Since the mid-twentieth century this interpretation has be  -
gun to change. In the 1 970s Peter Brown defined the years from 200 to 800 as ‘Late Antiquity’ — a period distinguish -
 ed by its own art, literature, culture, and encompassing a 
wider geographic area including the Byzantine Empire and the Near East. Continuing efforts to re-envision the period 
are changing perceptions of people and networks and are 
also recasting this era from one of gloom to one of transfor -
mation. Nevertheless, the dismal image of the Early Middle Ages 
persists in current and popular culture. Recent political dis-
course uses the phrase ‘the Dark Age’ to invoke impressions of decline and a lack of progress and innovation; these im  -
pressions are then utilised to draw comparisons to modern times (and the perceived threat of decline). Additionally, 
popular pieces set in the Early Middle Ages tend to charac -
terise the period either as extremely violent or as somewhat mythical (usually with dragons). Both interpretations focus 
on this ‘decline in the West’ narrative, highlighting the ideas that knowledge during the Early Middle Ages was scarce and 
that evidence about the period has been lost to time. 
As has often been pointed out, we use history to understand 
ourselves. We also project onto history that which we desire 
to support and understand in our own time. In other words, 
the early-medieval period has a long history of representing 
something besides the actual events and cultures of that age. 
This cultural baggage poses a challenge regarding how to 
discuss and present this period to wider audiences. But as we set out it is important to ask: how did the Early Middle Ages 
acquire so much baggage and misunderstanding? Is it pos-
sible to emerge from this ‘decline’ narrative with its focus on 
western Europe? If so, how can such a complex and intercon -
nected period be presented to a wider audience? And how can technology and engagement of the senses help us un  -
derstand the diversity and connectivity of this time? The fol -
lowing chapter will address these questions and more by exploring the practical and theoretical challenges that this 
particular period presents.  << A MEDIEVAL CITY?
When the medieval fortress of  
the city of Carcassonne (France) had fallen into disrepair in the  1 9th century, it was renovated by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. His restora -
tions frequently combined histori -
cal fact with creative modification, and have been criticised for estab -lishing a finished state that may never have existed. Although not authentic, Carcassonne is consid -
ered by many to be the epitome of a medieval city. It was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites and a popular board game was named after it.

Ages’; in every recent book on the subject, authors are 
expressing their annoyance with the name. And under -
standably so, since it downplays a thousand-year period as something in the middle, something in between: be -
tween the highlights of Antiquity and the Early Modern 
period, the old and the new. 
The term ‘Middle Ages’ has a negative ring to it, and it 
was meant that way. The early Italian humanist Frances-
 co Petrarca (1304–1374) used it to criticise the Latin of  
his contemporaries, exclaiming that he lived in an age  
of darkness. Antiquity, on the other hand, he saw in the 
light of its cultural merits. Petrarch used a metaphor of 
light versus dark that his contemporaries mostly used in 
the opposite way, considering pagan Antiquity a time of 
darkness and their own ante-modern and Christian time 
as that of light. Petrarch thus consciously reversed a 
well-known image.
Another famous Italian humanist, Leonardo Bruni 
(c.1370–1444), extended this metaphor of opposition.  In his History of the Florentine People (1442) he intro-
duces a division into three periods instead of two op -posed ones, with a recovery — later called a rebirth, 
‘Renaissance’ — after Petrarch’s time. Bruni’s division 
was followed by his colleague Flavio Biondo (1392–1463). 
So we owe the concepts of Renaissance and Middle Ages 
to the humanists, who declared that they lived in a time 
of renewal. Shortly after Bruni’s characterisation, the term media tempestas appears (‘middle time’, 1469), fol-
lowed later by medium aevum (‘middle age’, 1604) and 
media secula (‘middle centuries’, 1625): the period in the 
middle or in between.

"186 CROSSROADS EARLY MEDIEVAL EUROPE TODAYREFORMERS AND COUNTER-REFORMERS
During the Reformation, Protestants also projected their 
anti-Catholic sentiments onto the Middle Ages. They 
viewed Antiquity as a Golden Age, because then the  
earliest phase of Christianity emerged — when churches 
were made of wood, and Christians of gold. The Middle Ages, in their opinion, saw the corruption of the 
Church: popes who lined their coffers and ruled like 
princes; worship of relics and the related commerce; a 
clergy with double standards. This image of the Middle 
Ages comes to the fore in, for instance, the Magdeburg 
Centuries (1559), written by a group of Lutheran scholars 
led by Matthias Vlacich.
The Catholics for their part presented especially the 
High Middle Ages (c.1000–1300) as a period of social 
and religious harmony. Cardinal Cesare Baronio pub-
lished a refutation of the Magdeburg Centuries; in his 
Ecclesiastical Annals (1588–1607) he described the first 
twelve centuries of Christianity (up to 1198), narrowing 
down the term ‘Dark Ages’ to the late ninth and the 
tenth century, the end of the Carolingian Empire. In 
short, the term ‘Middle Ages’ soon became linked to 
Roman Catholicism and as such the period could be ap -propriated or disapproved. This was the beginning of a 
lasting tendency to either embrace or denounce the Mid-dle Ages, to exalt them as an artistic concept or present 
them as an example for a national style or identity.
LIMITATION OF THE TERM ‘MIDDLE AGES’
The beginning of the Middle Ages is usually set at the  fall of the West Roman Empire in 476: the moment 
when Odoacer (c.433–493) deposed the last West Roman 
Emperor, Romulus Augustulus (r. 475–476). Therefore 
the term ‘Middle Ages’ is applicable mainly to those 
parts of the world that were most influenced by this 
change: Italy, western and central Europe. The East Ro -
man Empire lived on in the Byzantine Empire and al -
though its history had its own highs and lows, there  
is no related concept of ‘Dark Ages’ or a ‘period some-
where in between’. The Byzantine Empire survived in 
various guises until 1453, when it was conquered by the 
Ottoman Turks — as a consequence its life span coin-
cides with the period called the Middle Ages in large parts of Europe (until c.1500). The Arab world also saw 
several periods of great prosperity during the European 
Middle Ages (see the contributions of Roggema and 
Mostert). The concepts of ‘Antiquity’, ‘Middle Ages’ and 
‘Renaissance’ or ‘Modern Age’ that dominate our manu-
als of cultural history consequently refer to a periodisa-
tion that is in fact limited to a small part of the world. JULIUS CAESAR’S  
THE GALLIC WAR 
The account that Julius Caesar 
(100–44 BC) wrote of his con -
quest of Gaul was originally written and copied on papyrus rolls. None of these have survived. The two old -
est copies of De bello Gallico go back to Charlemagne’s time; this is one of them. The manuscript, writ -
ten in Carolingian minuscule, was coveted by scholars, by Pope Greg -
ory XV (r. 1 6 21–1 6 23) and by a ju -
rist from Amsterdam, who stole it from his mentor’s library. In 1 706 the Athenaeum Illustre (the Univer -
sity of Amsterdam’s predecessor) bought the famous manuscript  at the auction of the Amsterdam merchant Jan Six’s library. Parch -
ment, AD 850–900."
"187THE AGE OF REASON
European philosophers and authors of the eighteenth 
century had an even gloomier view of the Middle Ages 
as medieval society was imbued with religion, which 
they considered the opposite of the concept of reason 
that was central to Enlightenment thinking. Because 
these thinkers considered their own time enlightened, 
the perceived contrast to the dark Middle Ages was en -
hanced and seen from an anti-clerical and anti-religious 
point of view. This strain of criticism is particularly 
prominent in Voltaire’s Essay on the Customs and Spirit 
of Nations (1756), which describes how medieval France 
wasted away in ‘confusion, tyranny, and barbarity’.  
Voltaire presents a period of ‘ten centuries, an almost 
continuous succession of crimes and disasters’. Enlight-
enment philosophers decried Gothic art, feudalism, 
Scholasticism, moral decay, anarchy, political terror, and 
the lack of knowledge of classical culture and Latin that 
according to them characterised the entire Middle Ages. 
Montesquieu (1689–1755) in his Considerations on the 
Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and Their Decline 
(1734) examines the fall of the West Roman Empire and 
the period that followed it. In his The Spirit of the Laws (1748) he considers the early-medieval Merovingian so -
ciety more closely, as well as the Frankish kings before it, based on Julius Caesar’s The Gallic War and Tacitus’  Germania. Montesquieu’s argument rests on the view 
that concentrated power does not necessarily make for  
a strong state, which implies criticism on the French 
state under Louis XIV (r. 1643–1715). The early Middle Ages thus were relevant to a contemporary situation.
It is remarkable that precisely eighteenth-century litera-
ture betrays a lively interest in medieval daily life, which 
provided a colourful setting for theatre and novels. Vol-
taire also wrote plays against a medieval background. Yet 
the philosophes’ extremely negative concept of the Mid-
dle Ages was part of a stereotyping trend that was to last 
for centuries: later examples include influential works 
such as Edward Gibbon’s History of the Decline and Fall 
of the Roman Empire (1776–1788) and Jacob Burckhardt’s 
The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy (1860).

"188THE GOTHIC REVIVAL
At the end of the eighteenth century there was a striking 
change in the assessment of the Middle Ages. The art 
historian, writer and politician Horace Walpole (1717–
1797) initiated a revival of medieval styles in the arts.  
He had a Neo-Gothic villa built, Strawberry Hill House, 
and wrote the novel The Castle of Otranto (1764), in 
which the dark image of the Middle Ages is given an 
attractively dramatic character. As the book was first 
published, Walpole pretended that he had discovered

century editor of the bard Ossian’s works, claimed to have translated  a rediscovered Gaelic epic, but scholars agree that he composed  it himself on the basis of old folk-tales and songs he had collected. The epic became immensely pop -ular; it was seen as a Nordic coun -
terpart to the Iliad  and in  fluenced 
literature, painting and music.

"189and translated a late-medieval Italian text — only later 
did he admit to being the author. This first Gothic novel 
set the trend for Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818),  
the works of Edgar Allen Poe (1809–1849), and Bram 
Stoker’s Dracula (1897). While the word ‘Gothic’ had 
been a term of abuse comparable to ‘vandal’, the adher -
ents of the Gothic Revival, a mainly literary and artistic movement, turned it into a proud nickname. 
The Middle Ages clearly stirred the imagination of the 
late eighteenth century. The works of the Celtic bard 
Ossian, published by James Macpherson between 1760 
and 1765, also were a pretended medieval find. Ossian’s 
works were admired by Napoleon as well as the Enlight-
enment thinker Denis Diderot (1713–1784), and were 
parodied by Voltaire. Medieval literary concepts and vis-
ual traditions also influenced the works of the poet and 
painter William Blake (1757–1827). In his literary works 
he often at tem   p t  ed to evoke the oral tradition of ancient 
epics, albeit with a mythology that was entirely his own. 
The texts, illustrated by hand, were beholden to medie-
val illuminated manuscripts. Blake was the first to apply 
the medieval art of book illumination in modern works: the genre of the artistic book had been born.  MEDIEVALISM IN THE VISUAL ARTS:  
THE PRE-RAPHAELITES
In all likelihood the excesses of the French Revolution (1789–1799) and the detrimental social impact of rising 
industrialisation contributed to a reassessment of the 
Middle Ages in the late eighteenth and the nineteenth 
century. Particularly the High Middle Ages and the Re -
naissance were viewed with nostalgia as a time of har -
mony, both socially and ecologically, and as an age of spiritual depth. We can see this most clearly in the works 
of the Pre-Raphaelites, the Nazarenes, and the Arts and 
Crafts movement. As the name implies, the Pre-Raph-
aelite Brotherhood aspired to a return to the art from 
before the time of the High-Renaissance painter Raphael 
(1483–1520). They combined a focus on the art of the 
Quattrocento and the Flemish Primitives with the view 
that medieval society had possessed a spiritual and crea-
tive integrity that was lost in later times. The Brother -
hood was founded in 1848 by the painters William Hol-man Hunt, John Everett Millais, and Dante Gabriel 
Rossetti. They rejected central principles of painting that 
had been in force since the Renaissance, such as imita-
tion of reality, realism based on independent observation

"190of nature, and a tempered colour palette that was a prin-
cipal tool of illusionist painting from the Late Renais-
sance onward. The Pre-Raphaelites in their turn strove 
for a clear-cut use of colours, sharp and precise detail, 
and sacrificed realism to an idealised composition that 
often appears rather flat. 
The Brotherhood was influenced by the famous art  
critic John Ruskin (1819–1900), who combated artistic 
convention and the mechanisation and standardisation 
he saw in contemporary arts, especially in architecture. 
In this context he praised Gothic architecture, in which 
he saw a freedom of natural shapes and expression by the 
craftsmen who constructed and embellished a building. 
Ruskin linked this freedom to a natural and organic  
relationship between the craftsman and his social and 
natural environment, and the relationship between the 
craftsman and God. 
MEDIEVALISM IN ARCHITECTURE
During this period the Gothic Revival boomed in archi-
tecture; it was assumed that Gothic art was imbued with 
Christian values, which had been suppressed by ‘ratio-
nal’ Classicism and industrialisation. The Classicising 
style of the eighteenth century was associated with 
republicanism and liberalism; Neo-Gothicism with reli-
gion, monarchy, and conservatism. In Great Britain the 
Neo-Gothic style was used in churches and colleges, but 
also in rebuilding the Palace of Westminster after the  
fire of 1834. In France the Neo-Gothic movement was 
led by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc (1814–1879), who gained 
renown with his numerous restorations of and additions 
to buildings, especially churches that had been damaged 
or destroyed during the French Revolution. 
The champion of Neo-Gothicism in the Netherlands 
was Pierre Cuypers (1827–1921), the architect of the 
Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the designer of at least 
a hundred churches, seventy of which were actually 
built. In the Netherlands the Neo-Gothic movement 
was tied in with Roman Catholicism more than in  
Great Britain. The French king of the Netherlands Louis 
Bonaparte (r. 1806–1810) had established regulations  for greater liberty of religion, from which especially 
Roman Catholics benefited: they had been prohibited 
from expressing their faith in public since the Dutch 
Revolt, and mass was only tolerated in secret churches. 
Owing to the mitigated regulations Neo-Gothic archi-
tecture became the hallmark with which Dutch Catho-
lics showed their renewed confidence. The concept of especially the High and Late Middle Ages was linked to Catholicism or the monarchy. The heritage of the Early 
Middle Ages plays a remarkable role in the self-represen-
tation of several European states. 
NATIONALIST USES OF THE MIDDLE AGES
The transition period of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages — with the fall of Rome, the Migration 
Period, and the rise of several smaller successor states —  
was often seen as a milestone in European history.  
Various European states have pointed to this period as their time of birth: France was born from the Frankish 
realm, England from the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. The 
example of the pretended discovery of Ossian’s works by 
the Scotsman Macpherson shows that the past was used 
to create a ‘Celtic’ (and even a ‘Gallic’) identity. From the 
nineteenth century onwards, various European peoples 
looked to the Early Middle Ages in their search for their 
own national, cultural, or religious identity and a past to 
go with it, whether it was ‘Catholic’, ‘Celtic’, ‘French’ or 
‘English’, and rewrote history from that perspective.
An example of this is Napoleon’s use of jewellery from 
the grave of the legendary Childeric I (r. 457–481/2), 
king of the Salian Franks and one of the founders of the 
Merovingian dynasty. After Childeric’s death, he was 
buried in Tournai (in present-day Belgium), and his son 
Clovis I (r. 481/2–511) succeeded him. When Childeric’s 
grave was discovered in 1653, it contained gold-and- garnet jewellery, including 300 gold bees or cicadas 
inlaid with garnet that had originally decorated the 
king’s clothes. The treasure fell to Louis XIV and later 
made quite an impression on Napoleon. When the 
emperor was looking for an heraldic symbol to replace 
the Bourbon fleur ­de­lys, he chose Childeric’s bees.
The German emperors were into ‘medievalism’ as well and made public appearances in medieval costumes. 
King Ludwig II of Bavaria (r. 1864–1886) had a Neo-
Gothic fairy-tale castle built in Neuschwanstein and had 
it decorated with scenes from Richard Wagner’s (1813–
1883) operas. Wagner’s works are another clear example 
of a Romantic translation of medieval literary tradition; 
they are part of contemporary cultural reception of me -
di eval epics as ‘national’ heritage, like the Nibelungenlied 
(Germany), the Cantar de mio Cid (Spain), Beowulf (Great Britain) and La Chanson de Roland (France).  
Wagner’s operas were used again in Nazi Germany to 
promote a ‘Germanic’ national identity. 
CROSSROADS EARLY MEDIEVAL EUROPE TODAY"
"191THE BIRTH OF THE FANTASY GENRE
The emergence of fantasy novels likewise fits into the 
reception of medieval literary tradition. Its most re -
nowned representative is J. R. R. Tolkien, who set his 
tales of magic and monsters or Mischwesen — dragons, 
trolls and elves — against a pseudo-medieval back -
ground. Tolkien was imitated not only by later writers, but gave rise to an endless stream of films, computer 
games, LARP games and other popular culture. Inciden-
tally, reception of the Middle Ages in film and popular 
culture nowadays is the subject of a separate field of 
study. Tolkien was Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford; 
it is no surprise that he was a devout Catholic and very conservative in his views. His aversion to industrialisa-tion repeatedly surfaces in The Lord of the Rings; at the 
end, for instance, the cosy Shire appears to have fallen prey to modern times.
NEW FIELDS TO BE EXPLORED
Several subjects still merit attention when it comes to reception and appropriation of the Middle Ages. The 
history of restoration practices could be such a subject;  
it would be interesting to take a closer look at the re -
storer Antonio Muñoz (1884–1960), who renovated sev -
eral early-medieval churches in Rome at his discretion, ‘freeing’ them from all later elements, especially Baroque

"192ones. ‘National’ presentations in museums and the part 
of medieval heritage in them could also prove a fruitful 
field of research. Studies such as Bonnie Effros’s Uncov ­
ering the Germanic Past: Merovingian Archaeology in France (2012) show that nationalist stereotypes regar -
ding the Middle Ages play a role in archaeology as well.  It is also noteworthy that the American art historian 
Alexander Nagel recently stressed the importance of 
medieval artistic traditions and methods for modern  
and contemporary art. 
CONCLUSION
As mentioned above, the term ‘Middle Ages’ as indicat-ing a period between two highlights regards only part  
of Europe. If, for instance, we ask about the reception of 
the Byzantine Empire, and who its modern descendants 
are, we are left with more questions than answers. Mod-
ern Greece sees itself as the heir of ancient Athens first 
and foremost, although it feels connected to the Byzan-
tine Empire as well. Elsewhere however the Middle Ages — the ‘dark period in between’ — have been an 
ever-new starting point for national, religious, artistic or 
personal appropriation or rejection, and thus a source of 
endless creativity.

EVAL EUROPE  
IN MODERN MUSEUM  
PRESENTATION
Wim HupperetzThe presentation of a certain period is always connected 
with our own time. If we want to discuss the presen -
tation of the Early Middle Ages in museums, we will 
have to take a closer look at the concept of that period: 
what do we mean by ‘Early Middle Ages’? And we will 
soon find ourselves in the nineteenth century. The con-
cept of ‘Middle Ages’ is, to a great extent, a nineteenth-
century invention, a construct one cannot disconnect 
from the rise of the Western European nation states.  
At the time many European countries were looking  
for originality and authenticity, and this movement was 
strengthened by searching history for the beginnings  
of the nation. As a consequence nineteenth-century 
Western Europe saw the beginning of a large-scale  
study of the medieval past, which was associated with 
concepts such as community, identity and authenticity. 
Within the medieval period, the Early Middle Ages were 
also called the ‘Dark’ Middle Ages. This characterisation 
is attributed to Petrarch, the fourteenth-century Italian 
humanist who contrasted it with the light of Classical 
Antiquity, which he saw as an age of flourishing. The 
term ‘Middle Ages’ itself, coined in the Renaissance, never disappeared and is still in use today. Which goes to  
prove that the scripts of our national histories, the way we view our past, have been determined by nineteenth- 
century nationalism and regionalism.CONTROVERSIAL RESTORATION

(the Netherlands), built in the  1 3th century, is the only remaining Dutch example of a Late Roman -
esque church. In the 1 9th century  a radical and highly controversial restoration of the Munsterkerk  was conducted by Pierre Cuypers (1 827–1 921), the architect who later designed the Amsterdam  Rijksmuseum. Picture left: before, right: after the restoration. "
"194The above does not apply, however, to the part of 
Europe that once belonged to the Byzantine Empire.  
In that region the period that we call the Middle Ages  
is regarded as one of prosperity. 
MEDIEVAL ILLUSION
The illusion of the Middle Ages is mirrored in nine-teenth-century architecture, when the Neo-Roman  
and Neo-Gothic styles were meant to create a medieval atmosphere. They were a way to literally build a national 
style, which was predominant especially in Germany 
and France, and the numerous edifices from that period 
remind us of the desire to go back to a distant past.  
Early-medieval material culture probably was repre-
sented best in church treasures and libraries. The archae-
ology of the Early Middle Ages as we know it, with its 
specific grave-field research, was completely unknown 
in the nineteenth century; over the first half of the twen-
tieth century, it was to yield a huge number of burial 
finds. What part did the representation of the Middle 
Ages in museums play in this context? The museums 
that were founded in the second half of the nineteenth 
century tried to bring across the historical narrative on 
the Early Middle Ages: Christianisation, migration, the 
birth of feudalism. This complex narrative was illus-trated with the help of the abovementioned church 
treasures and a mix of onomastics, regional types of  
pottery, and burial finds which mainly reflected the cul-
ture of the elite. The complexity of the Early Middle 
Ages in Europe was further increased by the dynamics  
of new and shifting geographical boundaries. Combined 
with a lack of historical sources, it was enough to keep 
the phrase ‘Dark Middle Ages’ alive. 
In our present society we are in fact still sticking to nine-teenth-century concepts: we are still trying to identify 
various groups by their brooches, disc fibulae, coins, pot-
tery or burial rituals. The archaeological evidence in this search for identity, however, is also part of a scholarly 
debate; the clearer and more refined our archaeological 
data become, the less the origin myths stand up to scru-
tiny — the constructed or fictional stories explaining the 
origin of a nation or people. Despite the fact that we have debunked those myths, 
archaeological presentations are still founded on the 
same regional cultures. National, provincial, and local 
museum collections often still reflect these cultures, and 
it is the highlights from elite graves and treasures that  
are on display. This is due mostly to a lack of alternative 
narratives and to a fear of acknowledging and offering 
complexity. 
THE DIGITAL-HERITAGE PARADOX
What museums need, therefore, is instruments to pre-
sent the complexity, diversity, and connectivity of this 
highly important period in European cultural history. 
Digital visualisation technologies appear to be a promis-
ing tool; but as a result of the rise of digital possibilities,  
CROSSROADS EARLY MEDIEVAL EUROPE TODAYFANTASY AND NATIONAL HERITAGE

"195a situation is gradually coming about where the tradition 
of museum praxis and rapidly advancing technology no 
longer join up seamlessly. This may lead to a frustration 
on both sides that I call the digital-heritage paradox.
On the one hand there is the impotence, reluctance and 
on occasion a certain degree of incompetence and lack of 
understanding on the museum’s part to anticipate the 
new opportunities that information technology offers. 
On the other, both visitors and stakeholders expect mu -
seums, like other social institutions, to make use of the 
advantages of these new technologies. This concerns not 
just organisational aspects but also content. The post-
modernist view that on the basis of the critical heritage 
theory points to the fact that museum objects are part of 
a complex, layered and dynamic historical context, 
comes into play here. It leads, for example, to our no 
longer using a single story line or narrative, but different 
perspectives or angles of approach. In addition we are 
also dealing with an increasingly strong image culture 
that is influenced by powerful visualisations. It is becom-ing easier by the day to create technically advanced image 
reconstructions: reconstructions of lost buildings, for 
ex  ample, or facial reconstructions of historical figures. 
The scientific basis for these reconstructions cannot by 
any means always be checked, while the impact is often disproportionately large.
These generalising and powerful visualisations are fre-
quently at odds with the abovementioned problematis-
ing postmodern heritage praxis, because they offer a 
static and generalised view of our heritage. We could 
also compare this with a generalist demand versus a spe-
cialist supply. This may lead to frustration on both sides.CHURCH TREASURE
Early-medieval material culture 
probably was represented best in church treasures and libraries.  The treasure of Xanten Cathedral is an example of traditional museum display.
EARLY MEDIEVAL EUROPE IN MODERN MUSEUM PRESENTATION"
"196NARRATIVE AND NORMATIVITY
Under the influence of societal changes, the exhibition 
praxis in museums is in a state of flux, and museums  
are mutating from traditional museums into lieux de 
mémoire, places of recollection. Here we enter the com-
plex world of the story or narrative. I am deliberately 
overstating here, but I primarily want to make it clear 
that it is a major step from the relatively simple and tra-
ditional presentation of collections, where the curator 
offers an ‘authoritarian’ or dominant perspective, to  
an exhibition where visitors are able to create their  
own personal narrative. Quite apart from the question 
whether visitors really want all this, asking the question 
about differing narratives is already a big step towards 
(self-) reflection on the authority ascribed to museums.
In the museum of the twenty-first century we face new 
developments, such as the democratisation of knowl-
edge, the relinquishing of the difference between high 
and low culture, and contested heritage. In addition, 
there are increasing opportunities for cross-overs, such 
as powerful combinations with theatre, film and litera-
ture. Naturally we expect museums to adapt their pres-
entations to the community that nourishes and ‘frames’ them in the current socio-cultural context.
Heritage institutions find themselves in an ongoing 
struggle with the normativity of their principles of se -
lection, presentation and order. The constant wave of 
museum redesign, renewal and refurbishment over the 
last decade is a clear reaction to the changing needs of the 
public and the stakeholders. But what does this reflec-
tion on modernism that I have sketched above provide 
from a museological viewpoint, what is the gain and for 
whom? All kinds of dampening and delaying mecha-
nisms can be discerned in this renewal. Architectonic 
and legal limitations, for example, are conceivable when 
it comes to setting up, lending out or presenting the col-
lection. Founders, financiers and donors of collections or 
institutions often have an invisible, but far-reaching 
influence on the manner of presentation and sometimes 
keep an anachronistic framework in place.
DIVERSITY AND CONNECTIVITY:  
THE CROSS-CULTURE TIMELINE 
By musealising objects we take them from their ‘natural habitat’, their archaeological or historical context. The 
CEMEC project (Connecting Early-Medieval European 
Collections) is intended to stimulate the use of digital 
technology and to employ new media to tell the story  of the Early Middle Ages. With the cross-culture time-
line — an application that was developed specially for  
the Crossroads project — we are using digital technology 
to show the connections between the objects from the various collections, presenting their geographical, chro -
nological and historical context in a fresh and accessible 
way. 
The timeline consists of a large projection on a wall and  
a tablet-based app that visitors use to direct the projec-
tion, which provides them with information on a lim-
ited number of key objects from the various regional 
early-medieval cultures. A number of objects in the 
timeline is given a special treatment: they are made 
available in 3D to enable visitors to take an even better 
look while also interacting with the presentation. They 
can view the 3D scans as well as videos and pictures with 
extra information on the items. The timeline moreover 
is not static, but can be adapted to new insights and de -
velopments at any time. The exhibition curators can  create and modify object descriptions in the timeline. 
With this we engender ownership of the digital content, 
which is an important condition for its lasting use. 
INTERACTIVE MAP
The objects in the timeline are characterised by connec-tivity. The objects’ connections may be due to trade, 
style of decoration, pillage, pilgrimage, knowledge trans-
fer or family networks. The relations characterising a cer -
tain object are presented to the visitor through a map of Europe and the Mediterranean onto which the objects 
are projected. In this way every item has its own story -
line. They can also be joined, and hopping from one object to another may lead to unexpected connections 
bridging the distances between the various regional  
cultures and illustrating the connectivity. 
Thus we can explain that the garnets in a Frankish disc 
fibula (see p. 136) came from India and must have reached 
the Rhineland via various traders, and that ‘Coptic’ 
bronze bowls and Byzantine jewellery turn up across 
North-West Europe (see p. 35 and 115). Bronze cauldrons 
known from the Huns and found in Hungary (p. 161) 
attest to a connection with the Xiongnu territories in 
present-day Mongolia and northern China. The dirham 
of al-Mutazz bi-llah in the hoard of Muizen, Belgium 
(see p. 12), proves that there was a link between the  
Caro  lingian Empire and the Islamic Caliphate in Syria, 
while the drinking horn discovered in Belgian Tongeren (p. 80) turns out to be from Ireland. To visualise all these 
CROSSROADS EARLY MEDIEVAL EUROPE TODAY"
"197connections in the distant past we have also added the 
stories of people who travelled through Europe in the 
Early Middle Ages and who have left us some kind of 
travelogue — their stories provide the presentation of 
this period with a certain dynamic as well as a personal touch. 
A STORY OF ONE’S OWN
This innovative digital application in the exhibition  connects early-medieval collections of diverse regional 
cultures. Objects can be viewed more closely as 3D  
models, sometimes with more specific explanations,  
and visitors can go on a virtual tour of early-medieval 
Europe and the Mediterranean, where trade and pilgrim 
routes, migrations and wars were the stimulating factors 
for diversity and connectivity. 
This cross-culture timeline aims to offer visitors a better 
overview of this complex period by giving them the 
opportunity to make connections and perhaps even  their own storyline. It is a search that can be made by association, that can start anywhere — in any period or 
any region — and that will yield the most surprising  
connections. In this way the cross-culture timeline will 
not only give access to the complexity, diversity and  
connectivity of this pivotal period in European cultural 
history, but especially also give visitors an occasion to 
create their own narrative. And that would be a great 
step forward in the discovery of this exciting period. CROSS ­CULTURE TIMELINE
The main goal of the cross-culture 
timeline is enabling visitors to  explore the connections between early-medieval objects and the  diverse cultures from which they came. Visitors can control the  large projection on the wall with a tablet-based app, and find informa -
tion, 3D scans, and related objects.

THE CASE OF THE 
KUNÁGOTA SWORD
Eva Pietroni and Alfonsina PaganoToday most museums are designed as containers of ob -
jects, with the goal to preserve and make their shape and 
material aspect accessible to the public — not the sen-
sory one, which is neutralised behind a barrier of inac-cessibility. The relationships that are established among 
the objects are of typological and chronological rele-
vance. The fact that they are related to a sphere of life, to 
a perceptive and symbolic universe, patterns of behav -
iour, actions and living people, is often overlooked. The reason given by curators is that it is difficult to recon-
struct such values with a good level of reliability, since 
intangible information that comes to us from the past, 
especially from a distant past, is sparse and fragmented.KUNÁGOTA INSTALLATION

"199 STORIES BEYOND OBJECTSThus the problem is evaded and museums prefer to 
ignore their real task: narrate what is beyond the objects, 
human stories, visions, ceremonies, habits, beliefs, 
forms of representation, the ways of our societies, of  
us as individuals and of human civilisation. The recon-
struction of senses and of symbolic dimensions beyond 
the object’s appearance, however, can take the visitor to 
the middle of a vivid and powerful experience. This be -
comes even more imperative in the case of archaeological 
museums, whose testimonies are incomplete, lacking 
even an aesthetic value that could satisfy the senses.
BEYOND THE MUSEUM OBJECT
The purpose of using multimedia in a museum is the 
creation of an artificial system that technologically and 
symbolically reflects the ‘dimension’ of life. Thus it em -
bodies and transmits content that otherwise would not 
be perceptible, increasing the awareness and under -
standing of ourselves in the flow of history. History that is no longer far away, ‘behind the scenes’, extraneous, 
but becomes part of our present and floods us with 
voices and colours.
This is the role of narration and evocation inside muse-
ums. Objects become the occasional points where his-
tory condenses, ‘coagulates’. Indeed a dramaturgy takes 
place. Storytelling is the fundamental tool that allows  
us to recreate the context, to penetrate the form and 
meaning of things. The act of narrating does not mean 
merely providing captions or descriptions. It means  
creating a harmonic convergence of script, image, light, 
sound, mood and atmosphere, in order to compose an 
expressive unit of which the object is the protagonist, 
the starting point and the end. The more the essence  
of the message is conquered, the greater the emotional 
impact on visitors will be. Their ability to process thoughts, to understand and establish associations will 
be activated, but also their faculty to enter into a dimen-
sion of creativity and self-transformation.
Museums often are overly redundant: the exhibited ob -
jects are so numerous as to give the impression that they 
lack the living space. Similar objects are repeated in the 
showcases, recalling the usual analytical criterion which 
favours the comparison among the variations within a 
certain typology. The visitor easily gets into a state of 
information overload or frustration. Thus many objects 
are not looked at, or only for a few seconds, randomly 
selected. 
 Multimedia languages are a powerful means to com-municate the cultural object on three levels: legibility,  
contextualisation, and narration. They affect both its 
form and its content, the message it conveys. Moreover, 
the modalities of an object’s exhibition determine the 
narrative structure and consequently the language to  
be used and the level of interaction with the content.  
If media are enjoyed in the presence of many objects, 
along the main stream of visitors, mixed with ambient 
lights and noise, their contents will necessarily have to 
be explicit and quick to use, not too deep and evocative, 
the level of interactivity almost null.
If on the contrary they are played in a dedicated space, 
dark, quiet, predisposed to favour the visitors’ concen-tration, the level of sensory immersion, evocation and 
interaction may be more layered and deeper. As an ex -
ample we will discuss the work we created for the Ku -
nágota sword.
CASE STUDY: THE KUNÁGOTA SWORD
The case of the Kunágota sword — which is part of the 
permanent collection of the Hungarian National Mu -seum of Budapest and is exhibited in the Avar section —  
is an example of how an authentic museum object can be

Budapest Museum. The 3D model was obtained through structure-from-motion technique (CNR ITABC in collaboration with HNM)."
"200integrated into a multisensorial immersive narrative, 
combined with its virtual representation. 
The authentic sword originally belonged to the Avar 
chief of what is now Kunágota (south-east Hungary):  
it was found among the grave goods in his tomb. It dates 
back to the seventh century AD, a period characterised 
by the establishment of the Avar empire which lasted 
until the early ninth century (see the contribution by 
Rácz and Szenthe). In its early period, Avar culture bore 
the marks of many different cultures: Byzantine, Asian, 
eastern European and western European alike.
The sheets of gold applied to this sword formerly be -
longed to a Byzantine casket that was probably used  
to keep jewels; in all likelihood it was part of the spoils 
that Avar warriors took after a battle with the Byzan-
tines. The gold sheets were dismounted from the casket 
and reused to decorate the sword of an Avar chief when 
he died, so that it could accompany him in the afterlife  
in the blue sky of Tengri, according to their shamanic 
belief. The decorated sword was found lying beside the 
chief’s body, together with two sacrificed horses and  
goods from daily life.For the Kunágota case, an installation has been created 
where a holographic showcase containing the original 
artefact is integrated into a bigger projection wall. Multi-
media contents and lights alternate inside the showcase 
and on the wall during the experience. Since the installa-
tion uses techniques of illusion, full control of the envi-
ronmental lights is mandatory and it is preferable to lo -cate it in a small room or isolated space of c.15 m
2 that is 
dark and silent. The experience comprises three main 
phases: 
1.  neutral vision of the exhibited object, where the at -
tention is focused on the artefact in the showcase;
2.  details: analytic narration regarding the object’s parts and decoration, where the attention is focused on  
the holographic projection appearing inside the 
showcase and interacting with the real artefact.
3.  total vision: contextualisation and dramatisation  of the object, where the attention is focused on the 
bigger projection on the wall;
In phase 1 (neutral vision) we want to give visitors the 
time to observe the sword in its uniqueness, highlight-
ing the precious gold fittings, with non-invasive com-
munication. Visitors see the real sword, well illuminated 
in the showcase, and then a few holographic animations 
inside, magnifying some parts and motifs. At the same 
time they can read and listen to some essential informa-
tion about the owner, epoch and context of use. The de -
sign of the user experience here is intended to slowly involve visitors in the narration.   
Phase 2 is the final part of the narration: we bring  
back the visitor’s attention to the authentic object and 
tell the story of its gold decorations. The evocation is 
brought inside the showcase, as a holographic projection 
and a story told by a mix of voices and whisperings, 
recalling events, episodes and personages belonging to 
the ob ject’s past life. It is a first-person drama. What we 
show here is the Byzantine casket in its original context, its being taken during battle, its dismantling and the 
adaptation of the gold sheeting to the sword once the 
Avar chief had died. We explain that the gold figures, 
belonging to classical Greek culture, were mostly unin-
telligible to the Avars: they did not keep them intact. 
Holographic animations are projected directly onto the 
real Kunágota sword and around it. Here it is important 
to create the illusion of bringing specific components of 
the authentic object to life, such as the single gold pieces 
or the grip. This evocation is organised in different 
scenes, introduced by short, clarifying titles. 
The narrative style in phases 2 and 3 is not descriptive but metaphysical and evocative, even if based on scien-
tific studies. At this stage the opportunity to virtually 
include the authentic sword into the ancient Avar 
imagery turns out to be essential: visitors need to find  
a connection with the exhibited object and its virtual

tual casket inside the showcase containing the sword (CNR ITABC

"201representation in order to understand that it was in  ves -
ted with symbolic and ritual values. 
In phase 3, we want to dramatise the original find con-
text, the Avar tomb, trying to visually represent on a  
big surface the ancient beliefs around death. Thus a con-textualisation scene begins to form on the wall, with the 
real sword still visible in the middle. After that, the light-
ing on the real sword is switched off, it is substituted by 
its virtual replica, and the projection spreads on the wall 
and on the surface of the showcase. The sword becomes 
the protagonist of an animated dramatisation and we can 
see the tomb in which it was found. The tomb is placed 
inside the representation of the Avars’ view of the after -
life: the tree of life connecting the earth to the blue sky. The tomb is shown in the ground between the roots of 
the tree; the dead warrior can mount his horse, lying 
beside him, and ride to the sky.  
LED lights on the objects are managed in real time; they 
become part of the visual drama and video composition, 
thus playing a fundamental role in the illusion. A back -
light creates a deeper space behind the hologram, en -hancing its effect, two side key lights (45°) illuminate the whole sword, four spot lights (5°) make the sword’s 
gold details light up. The integration of the different 
components is managed through an Arduino controller. 
Special attention was paid to keeping the characteristics 
of portability, reusability and sustainability of the equip-
ment, and to the security of the showcase.
CONCLUSIONS
Authentic museum objects, rather than a virtual repre-
sentation or a digital replica, are historically believed to 
be more important for their uniqueness. Such objects  
are considered to be able to speak to visitors in ways that 
a representation cannot. 
These beliefs are slowly changing, as museums need to 
move away from an object-based exposition in which it 
is assumed that the display of objects, with a relatively 
didascalic explanation, is sufficient to convey an object’s 
inherent meaning. New communication paradigms have 
been adopted by museums, especially the ones where 
cultural significance is conveyed through the integration 
of object, display, new media and narrative. The concept 
of experience becomes more and more central to mu -
seum studies.
In recent years psychologists, neuroscientists and philos-
ophers have established the role of emotions in creative 
processes and intuitive human knowledge: the knowl-edge and intuitive use of something always requires  
the activation of an emotion. Emotions can motivate 
understanding, conceptual appropriation, self-identifi-
cation, contributing to a higher cognitive process of 
learning. Therefore emotion, involvement, participation 
are issues of increasing importance in next-generation 
virtual museums as they represent a method to facilitate 
access to culture for everybody, promoting greater social 
inclusion. That is the reason behind the increased pres-ence of virtual tools in museums. 
Around the Kunágota sword, the case study presented 
here, an experience has been designed in three main 
phases. Each phase brings to the fore part of the infor -
mation needed to understand the museum object and  its context; each is characterised by a special mood and 
includes either texts, images, 3D reconstructions, sounds 
or special effects; finally, each phase tries to constantly 
immerse the visitors in the beliefs, rites and traditions  
of the Avar period. The three phases serve to complete 
the communicative process: identification of the object, 
contextualisation, and transmission of the related story 
following a conceptual and emotional approach. In this 
way visitors are guided to imagining a new dimension, 
‘discarding’ the museum space. They do not visit the 
mu  seum only to look at objects but also to listen to  
and be engaged in stories.

HORUS ON HORSEBACK
This exceptional window fragment shows the Egyptian god Horus in the dress of a Roman cavalryman killing the evil god Setekh in the guise of a crocodile. As Egyptian deities traditionally were never por -
trayed on horseback, this scene re -
flects the influence of Graeco- Roman models. Terracotta,  h. 46. 1 cm, 4th cent. AD.Publisher

A runic graffito in the Hagia Sophia, a gilt Byzantine 
helmet in the grave of a Frankish nobleman, a trea­
sure hidden from the Vikings in the Low Countries  containing an Arab dirham: these are just a few exam ­
ples of the telling early ­medieval finds in this book. 
Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages are often 
viewed as a time of decline, chaos, invasions and  war. But there is another side to this period as well. 
There was a rich diversity of cultures in Europe —  
from Longo  bards and Merovingians to Byzantines 
and Avars — and a lively exchange of goods and 
ideas, sometimes over great distances. The Vikings  
set up a trade network that reached to Baghdad;  
the Silk Road brought commodities to Europe, but also diplomatic missions, knowledge and ideas.  
This is illustrated by the interludes in this book, the 
stories of ten travellers: pilgrims, scholars, diplomats, 
and an elephant.
Despite the numerous conflicts, the period from  
300 to 1000 AD was also one of growth, continuity 
and peaceful coexistence. From the late eighteenth 
century a romantic view of the Middle Ages arose, 
resulting in the Gothic Revival and the art of the  Pre ­Raphaelites. Nation states today happily refer  
to the heroism of the Early Middle Ages, when king ­
doms were born and present ­day Europe began to 
take shape. TRAVELLING
