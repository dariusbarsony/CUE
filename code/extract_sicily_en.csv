"PREFACE
Sicily’s past and present are closely con-
nected to the coming and going of people 
on this island in the Mediterranean. In 
this publication we have chosen the  
perspective of the sea to better understand and appreciate Sicily’s rich cultural history. Never 
before were so many people adrift in and around 
Europe, and this has once more placed Sicily at the heart of migration flows and a clash of cultures. 
What started as a plan to present the maritime 
archaeology collections of the Soprintendenza del Mare on Sicily in a historical context, has led to  
an intriguing overview of the pivotal role Sicily 
has played in the Mediterranean. Soprintendente del Mare Sebastiano Tusa and Francesco Azzarello, the Italian ambassador to the Netherlands, have 
been indispensable to this project’s completion, 
and we owe them a debt of gratitude. The other loan givers on Sicily have also generously placed 
their collections at our disposal. The publication you have before you has  
come about in cooperation with the Zenobia Foundation and the Soprintendenza del Mare  
on Sicily. It is volume six already in the Allard Pierson Museum Series, which is published with WBOOKS in Zwolle. Sicily and the Sea was  
realised with help from the Mondriaan Fund and 
the Friends of the Allard Pierson Museum. Project management of the exhibition has been in the 
hands of Marian Schilder and a steering group 
chaired by Steph Scholten. 
Sicily and the Sea is the first result of a colla bo-
ration between a number of European museums sharing the same DNA: the partners in the  COBBRA Network (in Copenhagen, Oxford, Bonn, Brussels, and Amsterdam) will keep collabo-
rating and exchanging knowledge, colleagues and 
collections, and organising travelling exhibitions  to show our respect for the ancient world as well 
as its relevance to our own. WIM HUPPERETZ, Director of the Allard Pierson Museum"
"7PREFACETHE ROLE OF UNDERWATER CULTURAL HERITAGE 
The sea played a major role in the everyday life  
of many ancient inhabitants of the Mediterranean: anonymous fishermen and sailors as well as great 
authors such as Homer. 
The discovery of obsidian first and copper and 
tin later stimulated the beginning of naval trade 
routes and the first migrations. Coastal emporia, 
such as Thapsus on Sicily, gave rise to acculturation 
processes that caused great cultural change in local societies. The sea was the driving force behind this 
first wave of Mediterranean cultural ‘globalisation’ 
in the second millennium BC, thanks to the strong impulse given by the Mycenaeans. They were suc-
ceeded by the Phoenicians and the Romans.
The sea is a great biological reservoir as well as an 
immense historical and cultural archive that benefits 
not only scholars, but all people. A new way to enjoy 
marine heritage is rising all over the world as archa-
eological finds are left on the seabed whenever 
 possible. Divers are eager to view these treasures, while our museums are already full of artefacts from 
the sea that will remain forever in the storerooms.
In Sicily we have selected some underwater 
archaeological sites and entrusted them to associa
-
tions or individual divers under a contract giving 
them responsibility for the archaeological objects 
left on the seabed. 
Underwater cultural heritage management is 
growing rapidly, although it was neglected until a 
few years ago. Now there is much more attention 
for this vital part of our heritage, and we have an 
important tool at our disposal: the UNESCO  
Convention on the Protection of Underwater  
Cultural Heritage, which provides the main princi -
ples to guide us in the areas of research, control and management. 
Sicily and the Sea will be an important way to 
 
fulfil our duty to manage and promote underwater cultural heritage as best as we can.SEBASTIANO TUSA, Soprintendente del Mare, Sicily
FRANCESCO AZZARELLO, Ambassador of Italy in The Hague
It is with the utmost pleasure that I witness  
the completion of this important project. The 
project proposal was presented in July 2012  to 
both pillars of its realisation: Wim Hupperetz, 
director of the University of Amsterdam’s Allard 
Pierson Museum, and Sebastiano Tusa, superinten-
dent at the Soprintendenza del Mare of the Sicil-
ian region. All three of us united by passion and, if I may say so, by determination. T o Wim Hupperetz and Sebastiano Tusa I express my deepest gratitude 
for making this magnificent exhibition possible.
We hardly need recall that the history of the 
Dutch and of the inhabitants of Trinacria (as Sicily was called in ancient times) is connected with  
the sea. Seafarers, explorers, conquerors, fishermen, migrants.
A warm sea, the Mediterranean, with a human 
dimension, an intense and beautiful sea, and  nowadays, unfortunately, also a tragic one. Ideally, 
it unites all the countries and peoples that live 
along its shores and navigate its waters, with an intertwining of cultures and traditions that merge together and renew themselves. We need only think of the extraordinary ‘experience’ of Sicilian gastronomy, so rich in southern-Mediterranean 
influences, or of the wonderful monuments and 
historical and artistic artefacts which, spread all over the island, bear witness to the many invasions it endured, from the east, the west, the north and 
the south. 
Trinacria, an island that lies at a crossroads, both 
human and cultural, commercial and philosophical. 
The importance of this exhibition is the opportu-
nity it offers to a vast public in Amsterdam and in 
the other European cities that will host it, to get  to know and appreciate a substantial selection of 
objects from an enormous archaeological under-
water heritage, which so far has never crossed  the Sicilian borders. 2,500 years of history made 
visible the fruit of the innovative work by the 
Soprintendenza del Mare of Palermo. A joint  Italian-Dutch project, testimony to the constant 
and intense bilateral cultural collaboration, ex ten-
ded to the far south of Europe, so dear to us, and 
in which we continue to believe with conviction.Window Toward the Sea,

INTRODUCTION

As an island, Sicily is defined by the sea.  
As a place where people live or drop 
anchor, it is defined by the surrounding 
countries: the Iberian and Italian penin-
sulas, the neighbouring islands from Corsica to Crete, and by the European, African and Asian 
continents. Sicily’s symbol, the Trisceles (Greek  
triskeles, ‘three-legged’), represents the shape of  the island, also nicknamed Trinacria (‘having three 
points’, on the map. Due to its geographical loca-
tion, Sicily sees a continuous coming and going  of travellers, armies and peoples from every side  
of the Mediterranean. The multitude of material 
and literary sources attesting this convergence of cultures and structures are the subject-matter of this book. Its starting point is Sicily’s position in 
the greater whole of the Mediterranean, and  
especially what the sea has meant for the island.  In other words: what do we mean when we say 
‘Sicily’, and how has the sea contributed to this 
meaning? Is there a single Sicily shaped by various factors, or is the Trinacria a symbol of a perma-nent division?
A fortiori, modern studies are debating the  
issue whether there is an essentially Mediterranean culture or whether the Mediterranean world is a 
meeting place of developments, independent or 
otherwise. Scholars now often assume the internal cohesion and mutual connection of social micro-structures, termed ‘connectivity’. Quantification  
of material finds and research of their origins are 
important methods. The related ‘network theory’ is mainly descriptive and is based on the idea  that the ancient economy and social cohesion  
can be reconstructed from the available data. By 
using data collections and ICT we can make old materials yield new insights, so that for instance trade routes can be reconstructed based on the 
origins and distribution of various amphora types. 
Previous abstract discussions on ‘rationalism’ versus ‘primitivism’ in economy — i.e. the question of 
whether the ancient Mediterranean was a techno-logically progressive or an agriculturally backward world — are now seen as outdated: at present, it’s 
about hard data and the conclusions they generate. 
This method of categorisation, quantification 
and comparison is a reaction to the abstract and narrative practice of history that was predominant 
in the second half of the twentieth century. It was 
mostly propagated by a group of French scholars around the journal Annales, with Fernand Braudel 
as its most important representative. With his  
book La Méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen à l’époque de Philippe II (1949 ) he championed the 
longue durée (‘long term’), approaching the Medi-
terranean world of the sixteenth century from  
the broadest possible context. This context con-sisted of the geographical environment in which 
economic, social and political structures took 
shape, while individuals and events were reduced to foam on the oceanic currents of history. Tradi-tional historical questions about cause and effect 
were of minor importance. In the computer age,

CAPPELLA PALATINA 
The fabric of Sicily is a  
palimpsest of cultures,  
testament to the Phoeni-cian, Greek, Roman,  Vandal, Goth, Byzantine, 
Arab, and Norman colo-
nists and invaders. The Cappella Palatina (Palatine Chapel) in Palermo was 
commissioned by the  
Norman King Roger II in 1132 and was decorated 
by Byzantine and Arab

SICILY AND THE SEA  INTRODUCTIONThe Leopard) we find the wonderful fireside con-
versation between Don Fabrizio, prince of Salina, 
and the Piemontese delegate Chevalley who asks 
the prince to become a senator in the kingdom  of Sardinia — a predecessor of united Italy under 
the flag of Piemonte’s capital, Turin. The prince 
refuses because such a position would be mean-
ingless in his case, referring to the numerous  rulers the island has already known. ‘Everything 
has to change for everything to stay the same’ is 
his motto. In various passages by the famous twentieth-century Sicilian author Sciascia, the 
Sicilian soul is defined by uncertainty, illustrated 
by an inhabitant of the island looking out over  the sea, afraid to see another Muslim or Byzantine arrive. We have now entered the realm of meta-
phor, and metaphors belong to the domain of  
cultural history and collective memory: the  scholarly approach to mainly romantic concepts. 
Historical research that is not essentialist in 
nature will hardly be able to comprehend Sicily  in one word. Going back to its earliest history,  we scarcely find — differently from Sardinia, for 
instance — an original culture of its own with 
internal solidarity and external ties. Sicily’s cul-tures derived from their respective motherlands,  
so that there is no single Sicily to which the  
outside world related. Against the backdrop of a 
geographically diverse landscape, its history was  
an amalgam of various groups of inhabitants with  
a steady succession of varying rulers, often several at the same time. As to connectivity, the example  
that Jonathan Prag gives in his contribution to this 
book is a clear case in point: the battering-rams 
from Carthaginian and Roman ships, in a war these arch-enemies fought over Sicily, are techni-
cally undistinguishable. This indicates an equally-
paced technological progress rather than a direct exchange of knowledge, the equal pace possibly being furthered by craftsmen who worked for both 
sides, and captured ships changing hands. Romans 
based their ship designs on captured Carthaginian ships and, vice versa, Carthaginians may have been 
using Roman ships they had taken. Helmets and 
amphoras may likewise originate from either side: mercenaries and merchants served both sides. The finds in Sicily make it difficult to distinguish differ-
ent cultures. The Mediterranean world seems even 
more of a unity than it already was.of annalist history — man as the plaything of an 
unfathomable fate — has been replaced by the  
positivist view of network theoreticians. The 
French metaphor of longue durée has been super-
seded by the English one of connectivity, but  the views they represent share a broad vision of the Mediterranean as a catalyst of connections. 
The question of unity and diversity remains just  
as relevant, although the methods and theoretical framework to answer it have changed.
The historical sea storm has an eye: Sicily.  
Here the same questions about unity and diversity arise as they do for the Mediterranean as a whole, and varying answers are being given. As Sicily is  
a geographical unit, reinforced by its characteristic 
shape with orientations toward east, west and south, essentialist ideas have naturally developed 
with regard to it. Because the island was divided 
between various peoples and rulers for so long, modern history has identified division as its 
essence. Starting with the work of Sicily’s first  
historiographer, T ommaso Fazello’s De Rebus  
Siculis (1558 ), thinkers and writers such as Voltaire, 
Giuseppe T omasi di Lampedusa and Leonardo 
Sciascia have presented the succession of rulers  
as a factor that shaped the Sicilian soul, which  is sometimes referred to as Sicilitudo (a Latin  
neologism) or, with an Italianising word,  
Sicilianità — the former often catching the more 
positive tones of that soul, the latter its dark side.
In Chapter 4 of Lampedusa’s famous novel  
Il gattopardo (1958 , translated into English as  TRINACRIA  
Sicily’s symbol, the Trisce-
les or Trinacria, represents 
the triangular shape of the island."
"11SICILY AND THE MEDITERRANEAN WORLD
between these two peoples (264 –241 BC) was 
fought on Sicily, as countless material and written 
sources testify. 
Roman rule brought unity, but the dynamic 
history of the Sicily of the Carthaginians, Greeks 
and natives, a time of cultural revolutions and at 
the same time an endless story of war and con-
quest, turned into a more static situation. During the Roman period Sicily served as a granary for 
Rome, it was the stage of social revolutions with 
the first slave revolt, the monumentalisation of  cities flourished and wonderful sculpture and 
mosaics were produced. Sicily was ahead in the 
creation of new urban concepts and played an important role in the expansion of Christianity. After the Romans a barrage of foreign rulers fol-
lowed: Vandals, Ostrogoths and Byzantines passed 
and left their traces. In the Middle Ages, the island was inhabited by Jews, Christians and Muslims, 
living in harmony for centuries. Arabic culture, 
fostered by a Palermitan government, introduced In this representation of the facts, Sicily appears 
to be no more than the desired and fought-over 
stage where these international political events 
occurred. The actors of ‘connectivity’ are the  ethnic groups surrounding the island, which acts the part of Sleeping Beauty. In a broader sense,  
the colonisation by early immigrants such as  
the Sicans, Sicels, Phoenicians and Greeks bears testimony to the same process: Sicily as the link 
between cultures and periods, not as the deter-
mining factor in its own history. Y et the island was ahead of other European regions in countless  
matters in Antiquity: it is the cradle of several 
types of literature and performance, such as mime, bucolic poetry, and rhetoric. Great thinkers and inventors such as Empedocles (see pp. 43-44) and 
Archimedes (pp. 65 –67) engendered know ledge 
that spread throughout the world. Sicily’s art of 
coin minting was unrivalled in the world. The 
world power of the Carthaginians and Romans 
was made and unmade there. The first great war SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS 
In Antiquity, Scylla and 
Charybdis lurked in what is 
now the Strait of Messina, the waters that separate Sicily from the Italian main-
land, making the passage 
to the island a dangerous one. This 16th-century  engraving from the Civi-
tates Orbis Terrarum by 
Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg mentions both

pivotal role in foreign powers’ politics during the 
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In May 1860  
Garibaldi and his thousand volunteers landed at Marsala, coming from Piemonte, and proceeded  to attain Italy’s political unification. In 1943 it was the Allies whose ships and airplanes opened the 
southern front on Sicily and liberated Europe 
from the fascist regimes in Italy and Germany. 
Sicily’s integration into the kingdom of 
Italy — which took shape in 1871 , when the  
Vatican could no longer withstand unifica-tion — turned its gaze to the north. This interest 
went beyond Italy alone when in 1955  the 
Messina Conference was held, leading to the  creation of the European Economic Community two years later. T oday the position of the autono-
mous region of Sicily is crucial to guarding the 
border between the political powers of North Africa and the European Union. It is historically 
noteworthy that the Arabic loan word dwana 
(douane and similar words for ‘customs’ in French, Italian and Dutch, among others), originally signi-fying a type of taxes, became embedded in Euro-
pean idiom through Roger II’s Norman Sicily. 
Recent works such as David Abulafia’s The 
Great Sea (London 2011 ) are expanding the  
Mediterranean library (for other works, see the 
bibliography). The idea of the Mediterranean as  a unity has a recent political equivalent. Nicolas Sarkozy, then president of France, brought forward 
the idea of a Mediterranean Union in Tanger 
(Morocco) in 2007 . The Union for the Mediterra-
nean was established a year later and works toward 
ecological, economic, and social cooperation.  
The concept is as Roman as it is Braudelian, but has been overtaken by the present political reality. 
Instead of an equal development on both sides of 
the sea, there is a surge of migration from south  to north. Sicily more than ever is a factor in Euro-pean history, with the sea as the link between  
the African and the European continent. Contrary  
to the historic development, Italy is Sicilianising  
at a fast pace, taking Europe with it. A theme that 
is illustrated by the travelling exhibition ‘Sicily and 
the Sea’, which by displaying the material culture from every corner of the Mediterranean places  an old concept in new contexts.citrus fruits; street patterns from the Islamic world 
are found next to Greek grid plans; even today, the 
Sicilian dialect has many Arabic loan words. Some of these things were important contributions to 
European culture, while some were coincidental 
results of historic development.
Only later was Sicily’s own character sought in 
a unique combination of elements reflected in  
art, literature and religion. Under the twelfth- 
century Norman king Roger II Greeks, Arabs  and Christians lived together peacefully. At the 
same time, Catholicism became the dominant  
religion. Greek temples and Arab mosques were transformed into churches. Under the rule of  
Frederick II (king of Sicily 1198 –1250 ), we see the 
first Classical renaissance. Residing at Palermo,  
Frederick restored Greek as the official language; as the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (from 
1220), he modelled it on the Roman Empire. The 
dark side of Roman Catholicism came to the fore in the expulsion of the Jewish population in 1492 .
Sicily lost much of the splendour of relative 
independence under the rule of the French Anjou dynasty, which was attacked for its repressive char-acter in the famous Sicilian Vespers of 1282. After 
that, the island came under the dominion of the 
Spanish House of Aragon, which had come to the rebellious Sicilians’ aid. Four and a half centuries 
later, the House of Aragon was succeeded by that 
of Bourbon, also Spanish, and Sicily became part of the ‘kingdom of the two Sicilies’ with Naples  as its capital. The beauty of the remote island was 
being discovered by foreigners: from the sixteenth 
century onward, a lively European travel literature had started to flourish. In it, Sicily’s identity as a 
meeting point of cultures began to be recognised. 
In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  the Sicilians themselves started to describe and 
preserve their classical heritage.
Thus the social and cultural diversity which at 
first kept Sicily divided later contributed to a  
recognition of unity and independence. Y et real 
political independence never came about. There 
were periods of autonomy, but the island was independent for one year only (1848–9) — a status 
that in fact wasn’t much more than an intention 
determined largely by the revolutions washing over the European mainland. Sicily did play a

13SICILY AND THE MEDITERRANEAN WORLDSICILY’S POLITICAL HISTORY: A SURVEY  
To many peoples Sicily was a desired and 
fought-over place, a treasury of artistic relics, 
both material and literary. The Romans encoun-tered a culture established by Greeks: the myths surrounding the first king, Cocalus, the demi-
god Hercules, the goddess Demeter, the mythi-
cal ancestor of the Romans Aeneas; Empedo-cles’ philosophy, Gorgias’ eloquence, the politics of tyrants such as Gelon, Hieron and Dionysius; 
the architecture of temples and theatres. The 
military confrontation with the present rulers 
went hand in hand with admiration for the Greek 
past. The Romans’ relation to the Carthaginians 
on the other hand was dominated by a fear 
heightened during the Second Punic War  (218–201 BC) and decisively dealt with in the 
Third (149–146 BC). Carthage was razed to the 
ground and Rome was free to build its empire. While Sicilian politics and culture had been quite 
dynamic from the eighth to the third century BC, 
they turned static for centuries after that: after the creation of the first Roman province in 227 BC (with Syracuse as its capital from 212 on-wards) and the establishment of two naval bases 
in the west, the island’s most important charac-
teristic was its status as a grain supplier with an ingenious land owner ship system. Construction 
policy was based on Greek traditions. Taxes, 
slave revolts and corrupt governors brought 
some change in the rapidly Romanised prov-ince, as did Mount Etna’s eruption in 122 BC.  In 36 BC Sicily was the stage of Octavian’s  
(the future Emperor Augustus’) rise to power 
over the empire. In later Antiquity, Sicily’s image 
was determined by the estate at present-day  
Piazza Armerina, where a member of the imperi-
al tetrarchy allegedly resided under Diocletian.  
After a period of Vandal and Ostrogoth rule (AD 468–535), the Byzantines settled on Sicily in the 
Middle Ages (535–827), followed by the Arabs 
(827–1053). In the ninth century the capital was transferred from Syracuse to Palermo; in the 
early tenth century, the Shi’ite Fatimids took over 
the Emirate of Sicily from the Sunnite Aghlabids. Then it was conquered by the Normans (1053–1194), whose rule was inherited by the German Hohenstaufens (1194–1266, in the first place  
by King Frederick II (1198–1250), emperor  
from 1220. They were succeeded by the House of Aragon (1282–1516) and the Spanish Habs-burgs (1516–1713). At the Treaty of Utrecht in 
1713 Sicily was given to the House of Savoy, 
which after seven years was succeeded by the Austrian Habsburgs (1720–1734). The Spanish Bourbons ruled the kingdom of the two Sicilies 
from 1734 to 1860 (installing a local viceroy), 
when General Garibaldi from the north-Italian 
kingdom of Piemonte began Italy’s Unification 
from the south, on Sicily. Since that time Sicily  
is ruled from the Italian mainland by kings and 
presidents, with a brief interlude during the  Second World War, when the Allied Military  
Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT) 
governed it. In 2015 the first Sicilian president  of Italy was elected.

island lies in the south-eastern part of the 
western Mediterranean Basin. The Malta 
Escarpment forms the border with the 
eastern Mediterranean Basin, while the Strait of Gibraltar connects the western Basin to the Atlan-
tic. Sicily’s geological archive documents the very 
different origins and histories of three areas: the Hyblaean Plateau in the south-east, the Sicilian 
Maghrebides in the south, west and north, and the 
Monti Peloritani in the north-east. The Hyblaean Plateau borders on the Pelagian Block south of Sicily. Both belong to the African Plate and form 
the (African) foreland of the Maghrebides over-
thrusting from the north. The Plateau’s rocks mostly consist of horizontal successions of marine limestones from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (see 
inset for time frame). Between 7.5 and 1.5 million 
years ago, volcanic activity played an important 
role on the Plateau and its western margin. The 
Hyblaean landscape is very different from that of 
the Maghrebides and the Peloritani. The deep clefts in the central part of the Plateau are striking; 
west of Syracuse, the prehistoric necropolis of 
Pantalica (thirteenth to seventh centuries BC) consists of some 5,000  tombs cut into the lime-
stone rock.
The Sicilian Maghrebides are part of a moun-
tain arc which runs from the Apennines through Calabria and Sicily to North Africa; the arc 
encloses the western Mediterranean Basin. An 
undersea ridge between Sicily and Tunisia links the Sicilian and the North African Maghrebides. Around the Skerki Bank, which is part of the 
ridge, many shipwrecks have been found, includ-
ing five from the Roman period (100  BC–AD 
400). The Sicilian Maghrebides are the result of 
tectonic processes related to the African Plate’s 
moving north in relation to Eurasia. They consist of much-folded Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedi-ments, now ordered in a pile of nappes. The older 
sediments were originally deposited in a complex 
configuration of deep and shallow marine subsid-ence zones along Africa’s northern edge during Sicily’s Geological

the genesis of the ocean, which began as Africa 
and Europe started to drift apart after the  
break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea about  
200 million years ago. Once the oceanic rift had closed, the younger sediments were deposited. During this process, foreland basins developed 
from north to south at the front of the mountain 
ridge that was being created. The Caltanissetta Basin (central and south Sicily) is the largest; it is 
bounded by the Monti Sicani to the west and  
the Monti Madonie (up to 2,000  m) and Monti 
Nebrodi to the north. This basin, named after the 
town founded by Carthaginian settlers in the fifth  
century BC, plays a pivotal role in the research into 
cause and effect of the Mediterranean ‘Messinian Salinity Crisis’ (MSC). This desiccation process 
resulted from the connection with the Atlantic 
being closed up for 600 ,000 years, between 6  and  
5 million years ago. Throughout the Mediterra-
nean, gypsum and rock salt were formed. Salt mines that are still in use nowadays and numerous sulphur mines that were used until the 1980 s testify 
to the MSC’s economic importance for Sicily. T ogether with Calabria, the Monti Peloritani  
to the north-east form the Calabrian-Peloritan  
Block (CPB). Its backbone consists of Palaeozoic crystalline and metamorphic rocks that are over 250 million years old. Until 30  million years ago 
the CPB — together with Corsica and Sar-
dinia — lay on the east edge of Iberia, part of the 
European Plate. This piece of Europe has since 
migrated to its present position at the curve of  
the Apennine-Calabrian-Sicilian-North African 
mountain arc. It was only relatively late in this  
process, 10 to 8 million years ago, that the T yrrhe-
nian back-arc basin began to take shape. It is still evolving, and Calabria probably is still moving east-south-east at a pace of a few millimetres a year.
The highly different developments of the Hy - 
blaean Plateau, the Maghrebides and the Peloritani became increasingly intertwined in the recent geological past. This development was caused by 
four factors. Firstly, the Peloritani being connected 
to the Maghrebides by the thrust of the Calabrian- Pelorian Block over the Maghrebides along the 
WNW-ESE-oriented line from Longi on the DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL 
(DEM) of Sicily and sur -
roundings showing the  position of the Hyblaean, Sicilian Maghrebides and Peloritani areas, which 
have very different origins 
and histories. The present island is quite young,  geologically speaking.  
Its remarkable triangular 
shape is defined by major tectonic structures: the NNW–SSE Malta Escarp-ment, the complex E–W contact zone between the 
African and Eurasian 
Plates, and the orientation 
of the WNW–ESE major

most seismically active areas in the Mediterranean. 
The earthquake and tsunami of 1908  are infamous 
for the damage they caused at Messina on Sicily and at Reggio Calabria on the mainland; so is the earthquake that hit the south-west of the island (Belice) in 1968 . Several archaeological sites were 
partially or completely destroyed by seismic  activity, the best-known case being the temple complex of Selinunte in the south-west. Vertical 
tectonic motions on both sides of the Strait of 
Messina have resulted in a rapid and large-scale rise (50–150  m) of the Peloritani and southern 
Calabrian coasts over the last 125 ,000 years. 
T oward the west and south, the rise flattens to a mere 0–10  m at Palermo and Syracuse. Southern 
Sicily’s coastal zone, on the other hand, is subsid-
ing. A very active NNW-SSE fault zone of geo-
logically recent date is developing along the line Lipari-Vulcano-Tindari (Lipari and Vulcano being 
Aeolian Islands and Tindari a village in north-east 
Sicily) and on through the Monti Peloritani in  the direction of the Ionian Sea coast; the fault zone may represent, or develop into an extension 
of the Malta Escarpment. Another important fac-
tor is the regional effect of the global sea-level rise during the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, from 
the end of the last Ice Age, 20, 000 years ago. The 
present situation of several archaeological sites 
below sea level, partially or completely, is either solely due to the sea-level rise or to the cumulative 
effect of sea-level rise and tectonic subsidence. 
Examples include the Phoenician settlement (eighth century–c.400 BC) on the island of Motya 
(now Mozia) off the coast of western Sicily and the 
stone quarries along the shores of Sicily, Calabria and the southern Apennines that were exploited for 
the manufacture of millstones during the Roman 
period and afterwards. The Roman site (50 BC–AD 50) on the little Aeolian Island of Basiluzzo, over four metres under sea level at present, illustrates the 
cumulative effect mentioned above: about three of 
the over four metres of relative subsidence are vol-cano-tectonic, connected to the recent volcanic 
activity on the Aeolian Islands. At present, eruptions 
only occur on Stromboli. Mount Etna on Sicily has been active since it came into being half a million years ago; the volcanoes in the Strait of Sicily (Pan-
telleria and Linosa) are no longer active. north coast to Taormina on the east coast. Secondly, the Sicilian Maghrebides’ migration in the direction 
of the Pelagian-Hyblaean foreland from the Late Pliocene to the Early Pleistocene, reflected in the Caltanissetta Basin by the migration of successions 
of deep-water to shallow-water sediments with 
limestones and sandstones on top, on which cities such as Enna in central Sicily (942 m), Butera north 
of Gela (400 m), and Agrigento on the south coast 
(230 m) were built. Thirdly, the beginning of the 
regional rise and complete emersion of Sicily and Calabria in the Middle Pleistocene, c.600 ,000 years 
ago. Finally, the opening of the Strait of Messina, during the Middle Pleistocene as well, which  
separated Calabria from the Monti Peloritani.  
This divide was the result of a stretching, oriented roughly NW-SE, and the related vertical motions along (among others) NNE-SSW fault systems 
defining the present Ionian Sea coast of the Monti 
Peloritani (the Taormina Fault) and south Calabria’s T yrrhenian coast. The beginning of volcanic activ-ity at Mount Etna c.500, 000 years ago likewise 
indicates that the Middle Pleistocene saw the dawn of the contours and geomorphology of present-  
day Sicily.
Earthquakes and volcanic activity testify to 
continued tectonic activity in the region — Sicily, 
the T yrrhenian Sea and Aeolian Islands, the Ionian Sea and Calabria, the Strait of Sicily — during the

north of Sicily, which were created by the 
subduction of the Ionian Plate under the Tyrrhenian Sea. The oldest volcanic rocks are c.260,000 years old. Obsidian lavas 
originated during the youngest volcanic 
history of the island, starting c.10,000 years ago. The most recent ones date  from c.1500–800 years ago, when the  
volcano was last active. During an eruption 
a viscous magma, rich in silicon (over  70% of silicon dioxide, SiO
2), oozed down 
at a temperature of 700–900oC. It cooled 
too quickly to crystallise, so that the rock now consists mostly of volcanic glass. Its 
dark colour is caused by the presence of 
small quantities of iron and other metals.  Obsidian breaks with a sharp-edged con-
choidal fracture. This characte ristic ex-
plains its popularity since ancient times to 
make knives, spearheads, scrapers, and other tools. Chemical analysis shows that 
the obsidian used in Stone-Age artefacts 
from southern Italy mainly originates from Lipari.

The rich heritage that lies hidden in the 
waters around Sicily became the object of research after the Second World War. By the end of the 1950s the first experi

mental dives were already being conducted,  
with state-of-the-art equipment. At the time they seemed the dangerous adventures of reckless young men putting their lives at risk to explore 
 
an unknown world. Among these pioneers were Cecè Paladino and Francesco Alliata, creator 
 
of the first underwater films. By chance, they  
discovered and clumsily appropriated treasures that the sea had guarded for centuries, unaware that a new discipline, maritime archaeology, was about to be born. Applying on sea the same methodology used in land archaeology, a new generation of archaeologists started to develop on Sicily, led by Luigi Bernabò Brea and Madeleine Cavalier in the east and Vincenzo Tusa in the 
west. A long period of study and research led to 
the creation of the Soprintendenza del Mare, which took over in 2004. This agency has con

through more recent history to include ship

The astonishing discovery of the Dancing Satyr, which together with an unprecedented elephant’s leg and eleven rostra (ships’ battering-rams) was recovered from great depth in the Strait of Sicily, cleared the way for recent research at great depth, using the most advanced and sophisti

During the Roman Empire and the subse -
quent Byzantine period, there was a 
surge in the trade in construction mate -
rials in the Mediterranean, particularly in 
high-quality stone, among which marble was the most outstanding. It was shipped in blocks from which all kinds of building components could then be hewn, but also in the shape of objects or architectural elements that were finished or semi-finished: basins, capitals, sarcophagi, columns, 
and so on. The ships transporting stone, called 
naves lapidariae, could be huge, such as the ships carrying the great obelisks from Egypt to Rome. Around Sicily several shipwrecks are known of naves lapidariae laden with blocks of undressed marble, such as the one from the Imperial Age near Capo Granitola that carried Asian marble, and the ship carrying 350 tons of marble found at Isola delle Correnti (Punta delle Formiche).

of an authentic ambo (pulpit). The architectural 
elements were mostly of Proconnesian marble (Proconnesus being the present-day island of Marmara, Turkey), white with grey-blue veins.

ernmost end of Sicily, in the province of Trapani: the Phoenician colony Motya (which flourished from the eighth to the fourth centuries BC), 
 
present-day Mozia. This small island is the centre of the archipelago in the Stagnone di Marsala, about eight km long and one of the largest lagoon areas in Europe. The Phoenician city’s location in the Stagnone seems to indicate that the entire lagoon area served as a natural port system and that loading and unloading of goods for the 
 
Phoenician city took place near the North Gate, which led to the quarters with furnaces and the workshops where purple dye was produced.  From the North Gate a maritime causeway also led carts past the city and to the settlement at present-day Birgi on the other side. The cause
-
way originally was a massive construction meant to inhibit free navigation inside the lagoon. The ports of Lilybaeum (now Marsala) at the westernmost point of Sicily have yet to be explored; the three ports which gave this city its fame and prosperity in Antiquity lie on the sea floor off the modern city, covered in thick layers 
of seagrass. Photogrammetry and field research 
have made it possible to locate the ports: one 
 
lies near Punta Alga, in the bay south of the  
Stagnone; the one called Porto delle Tartane or Margitello is situated near the modern port; the most important one, opposite the ancient city centre, lies immediately north of Capo Boeo at the location of the modern rowing club. The city of Selinus had to process such a mass of maritime traffic that two ports were needed, one 
to the east and one to the west of the acropolis, 
near the mouths of the presently silted-up Gorgo Cottone and Modione. The latter river was known as the Selinon in Antiquity and gave the city its name. The remains of these ports found so far Sicily’s

penetration depends on the physical properties of the layers traversed as well as the power and carrying frequency of the signal transmitted by the acoustic transducer.

"29Sicily and the Sea 
     in PrehistoryJORRIT KELDER
It has been suggested that the earliest human 
activity on Sicily may date back to the Lower 
Palaeolithic, at which point the island may 
have been connected to southern Italy by a 
land bridge. The possible presence of these early hominids on Sicily at that point of time is, how-
ever, controversial.
From the Upper Palaeolithic onwards, human 
activity is attested by the remains of stone tools which have been found at the site of Fontana 
Nuova di Ragusa in the south (dating from c.15,000-11,000 BC) and at various other sites 
across the island (dating from c.10 ,000 BC). By 
this time, at the end of the last Ice Age, the shape of Sicily would have looked more or less as it does today — a large island, separated from the Italian 
mainland by a narrow strait. Very little can be said about these early ‘Sicilians’, other than that they probably hunted wild boar, fox, goats, bovids, and 
possibly a wild predecessor of the donkey, the 
Equus hydruntinus. 
Slightly more can be said about the Final  
Palaeolithic and Mesolithic period, at which point 
wall paintings and carvings not only demonstrate 
the early islanders’ artistic prowess, but also their connections with regions elsewhere. The earliest 
rock paintings known thus far are found in a cave 
at Cala dei Genovesi on the islet of Levanzo, near the tip of western Sicily. The paintings at this site date to c 9000 BC and are comparable with rock 
art elsewhere in southern Europe (such as 
Lascaux). Y et another thousand years later, we encounter the remarkably expressive rock carvings 
in the Grotta dell’Audaura, close to the city of 
Palermo. These carvings depict various human figures as well as figures of horses, deer and bovids, 
and provide a first glimpse of how the early Sicili-
ans perceived their world. The exact interpretation of these early carvings, especially the depiction of two masked (?) human figures with what looks 
like ropes around their necks, is unclear. It has 
been suggested that this may be a depiction of an initiation rite, although more extravagant 
hypotheses — including one suggestion that the 
carvings show acrobats, or even an early homo-
erotic scene — have also been put forward. 
Regardless of the precise nature of the human fig-ures in these carvings, the presence of bovids and equids demonstrates that hunting was an impor-tant aspect of daily life. The hunt was not only a 
terrestrial affair: archaeology shows that fishing 
was important, too. Indeed, the presence of dol-phin bones in the Mesolithic cave of Uzzo, on the 
Sicilian west coast, suggests that the early Sicilians 
already possessed boats that were sufficiently large to sail out into the open sea. 
From the sixth millennium BC onwards, the 
people of Sicily gradually adopted a Neolithic way of life. Most of the cave dwellings were abandoned in favour of proper settlements in the fields, and 
pottery made its appearance in everyday life. There 
are no clear arguments to suggest that this change in lifestyle was the result of the arrival of new-comers on the island (although this remains a  MYSTERIOUS GRAFFITI

PANTALICA NECROPOLIS 
Tombs cut into the lime-

the 13th to 8th centuries 
BC. Remains of houses and possibly even a pal-ace-like structure have 
been found, but it is un-
clear whether they are pre-historic or belong to later 
periods. In view of the

after the collapse of the 
Late-Bronze-Age system of international trade.possibility): the slow and piecemeal adoption of 
the Neolithic way of life rather suggests a local 
development, probably as a result of overseas con-
tacts. Obsidian, which was mined on nearby Lipari (see p. 17 ) and Pantelleria and has been found on 
Malta, Sicily and in central Italy, doubtless was an 
important trigger for these contacts. Other goods 
such as wool may also have played an important role in the development of early contacts between 
Sicily and its surrounding areas. Regardless of the 
details it is clear that, during the Neolithic at the latest, the sea had become a defining feature of 
Sicilian life: it served as a source of food, but al so 
as a connection to nearby Malta, the Aeolian 
Islands, and the mainland of Italy. It is very likely that these overseas contacts intensified and 
expanded as time progressed. Indeed, it has been 
suggested that the emergence of monumental, stone-built or rock-cut funerary architecture of 
the so-called Castelluccian culture — the designa-
tion for a number of regional and related cultures 
during Sicily’s Early Bronze Age (2500 –150 0  BC)   — owed much to Sardinia’s Bell-Beaker culture. 
T owards the end of that period, overseas connec-tions had multiplied and Sicily became a veritable gateway to the western Mediterranean for traders 
from the east. 
Sicily’s increased importance to long-distance 
maritime trade had a profound impact on local culture and everyday life, especially in the eastern 
part of the island. The Middle Bronze Age on  Sicily is marked by a notable increase in foreign, 
especially Aegean, Anatolian and Cypriot imports 
and the adoption of various Aegean symbols  (e.g. the Minoan ‘Horns of Consecration’) and architectural features (such as the arched ceiling  
of a number of tombs, which is often thought to 
copy Mycenaean tholos tombs). It is also a period of increased social hierarchy, with the emergence 
of local elites — who adopted these exotica as 
tokens of their wealth and power — and the  
development of a more centralised territorial (and 
probably political) organisation in the eastern parts 
of the island in which major, mostly coastal settle-"

the Mycenaean palace of Pylos in Greece: presuma-

By 1400  BC at the latest, there is every indication 
that Sicily was now fully integrated into the east-ern Mediterranean world of long-distance trade. There can be no doubt that Sicily’s status as a hub for Mediterranean trade also attracted immigrants. 
Thapsus, a site on an island off eastern Sicily, some 
10 km north of Syracuse, seems to have been one 
of the places where immigrants settled and min-
gled with the native population. The settlement, 
with its remarkably well-organised grid of houses and wide streets, served as a centre of trade (in 
view of the numerous Mycenaean objects and 
architectural parallels with ‘Mycenaean’ sites on Cyprus probably especially with the Greek world) with resident foreign (Greek?) merchants and 
their families. In many ways, Thapsus can thus be  
considered a model for things that were yet to come: the Greek colonies of the eighth and  
seventh centuries BC. 
The end of this period of extraordinary  
connectivity is marked by the downfall of the 
great states in the eastern Mediterranean. The 
causes of the destructions that marked the end  
of the palaces of Mycenaean Greece, the Hittite Empire in Anatolia, and the wealthy principalities 
in the Levant are still not understood, and it is 
likely that a number of factors (climate change, invasions, earthquakes?) played a role. Sicily, or 
rather its prehistoric inhabitants, may have played 
a role as well, for one of the monuments that report on these calamities, the so-called Great Karnak Inscription (a relief of Merneptah, king  
of Egypt from 1213  to 1203  BC), may bear the 
first reference to the island’s prehistoric inhabit-
ants. Amongst a number of invaders is a group  
of invaders called S-k-rw-s— normally vocalised as 
Shekelesh. There is no way of being sure about this, 
but it has been suggested that this name may refer 
to the Sicels; a group of people who are known 
from Classical sources to have lived in especially the eastern part of Sicily in pre-Classical times. The fact that the Shekelesh are referred to as 
‘coming from the sea’ only serves as a reminder of 
the close connection between Sicily and the sea.MYCENAEAN STIRRUP JAR

of the eighth century BC. The Greek historian 
Thucydides (c.455 –400 BC) writes that Phoeni-
cians had initially settled across south-eastern  
Sicily, but that the arrival of the hostile Greeks caused them to move to the western part of the 
island. Thucidydes mentions three Phoenician  
colonies: Motya, Panormus, and Solus. These three have been identified archaeologically on the island 
of San Pantaleo/Mozia, in Palermo and Solunto 
respectively, but earlier Phoenician presence on the eastern coast has not been confirmed. While 
the earliest evidence for permanent Phoenician 
settlement does not predate the eighth century BC, some level of Phoenician/Near-Eastern  pre-colonial activity — direct or indirect — can be 
detected from at least the eleventh century BC.
By the end of the sixth century BC, as we 
know from the first treaty signed between Carthage and Rome (509 BC), the western part 
of the island was considered Punic. Carthaginian influence over the three Phoenician colonies had started much earlier, but it is likely that by this 
time Carthage exercised some form of direct 
dominion over the colonies. In the following cen-tury, the colonies were ineluctably embroiled in 
conflicts between their Greek neighbours on the 
island and Carthage, which resulted in a treaty between the Greek tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse and Carthage in c.405  BC. The treaty did not last 
long and by 397  BC, Dionysius I destroyed Motya. 
The population left the colony, never to occupy it The Phoenician colonisation in Sicily during the Early Iron Age fits into the 
wider pattern of Phoenician expansion 
in the central-western Mediterranean 
and its margins, the Atlantic shores of Iberia and north-western Africa. Sicily was a pluri-ethnic 
island, with both Phoenicians and Greeks estab-
lishing their colonies among population groups already settled on the island: the Sicans, the Sicels 
and the Elymians. Although the ethnic divisions 
attested in written sources are not always archaeo-logically detectable (Sicans vs Sicels), the Sicans/
Sicels and the Elymians are epigraphically and 
archaeologically distinguishable. 
The Phoenicians founded colonies on the west 
coast, while the Greeks — whose colonising forays 
overlapped (and collided) with the Phoeni-cians’ — claimed a larger part of the island, on its 
eastern and southern coasts as well as on a stretch Phoenicians

circular in shape, it has a surface area of c.45  ha,

reproduces the typical topographical pattern of Phoenician cities in the homeland and in the 
western Mediterranean, e.g. T yre (Lebanon),  
Gadir (present-day Cádiz, Spain), and what is now Rashgoun (Algeria). It has been archaeologically 
investigated for decades; as a consequence, much 
information is available regarding settlement pat-terns, commercial and port districts, sacred areas 
and cemeteries established by the Phoenicians, 
whose presence followed a hiatus in occupation from the Middle Bronze Age.
The island was approached via two ports, one 
in the north and one in the south, which were again, instead building a new town: Lilybaeum  at Marsala on Cape Boeo on the Sicilian main-
land. The island itself continued to be occupied 
after the destruction of the settlement, although it  
had lost its ‘full urban status’. It was not until  241 BC — the end of the First Punic War — that 
the Punic colonies surrendered to Rome, which marked the permanent loss of Punic independ-ence on the island after decade-long battles at 
Lilybaeum, Drepanum (present-day Trapani)  
and the Aegadian Islands.
MOTYA
Motya was established on a small island off the western coast of Sicily, now San Pantaleo. This is 
the central and biggest of three islands (Santa 
Maria, La Scuola) located in the Stagnone, a "
"34
surrounded by commercial and sacred auxiliary 
areas. The sanctuary ‘Cappiddazzu’ was on the 
north-western part of Motya, located inland from 
the necropolis and separated from it by a produc-tion zone. A bit south on the western coast lay  the tophet, a sanctuary or sacrificial area for chil-
dren peculiar to western Phoenician/Punic settle-
ments, mainly in Italy and northern Africa. T o the south of the tophet lay the Southern Gate and an 
artificial port, the kothon. The habitation areas 
were located in the central part and in patches elsewhere around the island. 
This urban layout was attained gradually. By the 
last quarter of the eighth century BC, the north-western coast of the island seems to be ‘reserved’ as a sacred area: the sanctuary ‘Cappiddazzu’ and 
tophet are established there. By the beginning of 
the seventh century BC, this rather remote area had already started to attract production zones; 
these may also have existed in the south of the 
island, in the area between the later Southern Gate and the kothon. Early habitation areas were not concentrated in one particular part of the 
island, but have been found in patches all across it. 
No clear-cut urban plan is discernible, with the exception that streets are oriented towards the 
coast. A reorganisation and expansion of the urban 
plan is attested from the middle of the sixth  century BC onwards. While extant areas under-went expansion or reconstruction (the sanctuary 
‘Cappiddazzu’ and the tophet), new important 
public works were carried out, such as the mari-A HOARD OF COINS

strada), the Sacelli (the sacred spaces of the North-
ern Gate), as well as the kothon and its sacred com-
plex. Additional reconstructions of various types are observed in later centuries.
THE SACRED AREAS
The aforementioned Cappiddazzu sanctuary and the tophet constituted two of the five sacred spaces, 
the other three being a sacred area at the central 
habitation zone, the Sacelli of the Northern Gate and a temple near the kothon, the southern port. The Cappiddazzu was located 100  m inland from 
the Northern Gate. The sanctuary was initially (eighth–seventh century BC) an open-air space for cultic activities (sacrifices of animals): this is 
attested by bothroi, refuse pits dug in the ground, 
and the sacrificial remains. The first temple dates from the seventh–sixth century and belongs to  
the Near-Eastern type of the ‘four-room building’. 
The second monumental temple (sixth–fifth  century BC) was perhaps part of the wider recon-struction and transformation of the urban space 
and civic buildings on Motya. Successive recon-
structions followed, with a third monumental temple dated to the fourth century BC. The tophet 
also shows a marked phase of expansion during 
the sixth century BC; its location on an initially remote coast and on a low-lying beach must have been significant.
The so-called kothon temple was another major 
sanctuary with several phases of construction. Located close to the kothon, the temple seems to 
have been erected as part of the same complex. 
The earliest temple and auxiliary structures are dated to the eighth century BC; they were  followed by four superimposed structures. After 
the violent destruction of the first monumental 
edifice, a rectilinear building with internal  divisions of space was erected in the middle of  
the sixth–fourth centuries BC. The internal space 
was divided into five naves, a cella (inner chamber), adyton (restricted area) and central courtyard. 
Other elements point to the Phoenician custom 
of betylic worship (a betyl is a holy stone or  column). Based on archaeo-astronomical data,  the excavator, Lorenzo Nigro, has suggested that 
the orientation of the building followed astro-
nomical observations, as the axis of the building 
SICILY AND THE SEA  SICILY IN PRE- AND PROTOHISTORY"
"PHOENICIANS IN SICILYdid not conform to that of the kothon; rather, cen-
tral features in the temple (fossa, betyl) appear to 
have been positioned so as to align with Orion’s 
rising during the winter solstice and spring equi-nox. The assumption is that Orion was identified with Ba’al, one of the main Phoenician deities, 
whose death and revival was venerated with cultic 
ceremonies. Lorenzo Nigro has postulated that the astral symbolism may have been emphasised by 
the connection of the temple to the nearby fresh-
water pool (the kothon) with ‘its flow back to and from the abyss’. While a kothon functioned as a 
basin for the anchorage of ships, there is evidence 
to suggest that the Motya kothon during its second phase had been transformed into a closed-off pool. It must have been at this point that it attained a 
symbolic meaning in relation to the temple and 
ceased to function as a mooring place.
THE PORTS AND THE CAUSEWAY
Motya was connected with the outside world by at least two artificial ports, located at the north 
and south of the island, and possibly a third one  
in the south-east. The marine causeway connected Motya with the opposite coast on the mainland  at the location of present-day Birgi. It was 1700  m 
long and c.12  m wide at its base; the causeway was 
paved with slabs, on some of which the ruts left by carts are still visible. At Birgi, settlement traces 
and burial evidence have been identified that bear 
witness to this connection with Motya. The  causeway was intentionally destroyed, probably to 
protect Motya’s citizens from attacks by Dionysius 
of Syracuse, as attested by Diodorus Siculus (first century BC) in his World History. 35
The southern kothon during its first phase was 
an artificial basin dug into what may have been a 
former lagoon area, with embankments surround-
ing all its sides except the south, where a canal connected it with the sea. It measured 51  by 35 .5 
m. Near the port, a commercial area developed at 
the Southern Gate. The kothon would have been 
used as an anchorage point, but by the following century, a wall in the header-stretcher technique 
had been built in the perimeter of the rectilinear 
basin, cutting it off from the sea. It is possible that a third port or kothon was located on the south-
eastern part of the island, where a circular depres-
sion has been identified but not investigated.
PALERMO AND SOLUNTO
The two ancient Phoenician colonies of Panor-mus and Solus were located on the north-western 
coast of Sicily, in the Bay of Palermo, at a distance 
of 15 km from one another. The two were sepa-
rated by the valley of the river now called  Eleuterio, where indigenous (Elymian) settlements 
were situated. The Greek colony of Himera lay 
farther east on the coast. We know less about  these Phoenician colonies during the Archaic 
period than we do about Motya, as they now lie 
in modern Palermo and Solunto respectively. However, thanks to ongoing research some of 
their topography can be reconstructed. 
The earliest evidence for Panormus dates from 
the end of the seventh or the sixth century BC. 
Water bounded the settlement to the north and 
south; an ‘old town’ (Palaipolis) was separated from 
a later nucleus (Neapolis) by a river, while the necropolis was further beyond, also across a river PUNIC COIN

"type (625 –575 BC) and various wine cups (e.g. 
Proto-Corinthian kotylai (two-handled cups) and 
in the case of the acropolis, Attic and Ionian pot-
tery and their Siceliot imitations) that have been found in several areas on the island: in the vicinity of the kothon, but also on the acropolis, in settle-
ment strata, and at the necropolis. The neighbour-
ing Greek colonies of Selinus and Himera may not always have been well-disposed to trade with 
the Phoenicians, given some of the later histori c-
ally-attested conflicts with Greeks on the island. 
This evidence of commercial contacts may thus 
plausibly be associated with the maritime connec-
tions between Carthage and the T yrrhenian Sea, itself hosting Greek colonies (Pithecussae, Cumae) and well-connected with the Aegean as of the late 
eighth century BC.
Intercultural exchanges are observed in other 
life spheres as well. Influences in cult, for example, are detectable in neighbouring Elymian and 
Greek settlements. At Himera, a Greek colony located close to Panormus and Solus, there is some (contestable) evidence to suggest the  
practice of ‘sacred prostitution’ at sanctuaries,  
connected to maritime life, which finds its origins in Near-Eastern cultic practices.
The so-called Motya Charioteer, a highly unu-
sual male statue (p. 38 ), has also been explained in 
terms of intercultural contacts. Recalling Parian sculpture (in the Aegean school of sculpture, c.480 
BC) but unusual in the rendering of the clothing 
and posture, it has been attributed to a Greek sculptor working at the Phoenician colony. The 
idea was that it represented a Phoenician god  
(e.g. Melkart) or priest. A more recent suggestion by Olga Palagia is that the statue was part of a 
sculptural group originally commissioned and 
dedicated at a sanctuary by Gelon, tyrant of  Syracuse 485 –478 BC, over his victory at the  
battle of Himera, and subsequently looted by  
the Carthaginians, who took it to Motya. 
As to connections with the Elymians, there is 
historical documentation that shows their close political alliance with the Phoenician/Punic cities. 
The Elymian alphabet, however, despite the alli-ances between Phoenicians and Elymians, appears to have adopted the letter types of the alphabet 
used in the Greek colony of Selinus.from the settlement. The location of burial 
grounds across a stream characterises Phoenician 
settlements in the homeland and in the western 
Mediterranean; it probably related to eschatologi-cal concerns. The settlement was approached by the sea, where an inner and an outer harbour have 
been identified in the ancient estuary.
We know less about Solus than we do about 
Panormus. There were two ancient settlements  at Solus; the earliest one, dating to the Archaic 
period, lies south of Cape Zafferano on a rocky headland that plunges steeply into the sea below. The internal organisation of the settlement is not 
known, but its location was identified on the basis 
of some scanty evidence for houses and better-documented craft areas. A tophet possibly existed  
in the area. The necropolis probably lay c.800  m 
to the north-west. After the destruction of the  
settlement by Dionysius I, the later, Hellenistic 
settlement was moved to what is now Mount  
Catalfano farther north.
REGIONAL INTERACTIONS
Motya — and Phoenician-Punic Sicily in gen-
eral — had a key strategic location in the central 
Mediterranean, linking especially the T yrrhenian Sea with Carthage. From the end of the seventh century BC, trade connections with several  centres in Greece are documented by imported 
Attic wine amphoras of the so-called SOS  36
GLASS BEADS 
Two face beads. The big

and dates from c.600 BC; the smaller one to the right probably is from Carthage 
and is dated to the 6th

in the 7th cent. BC; the 
beads were exported to Carthage, among other 
destinations. Soon the  
design was copied in other parts of the Mediterranean and the Phoenicians trad-
ed in the beads. The black 
core of the beads indicates the hair and beard; the other colours were applied 
on top of the black.
SICILY AND THE SEA  SICILY IN PRE- AND PROTOHISTORY"
"37RESHEF, GOD OF MANY CULTURES 
Bronze, massive cast; surface abraded and 
corroded. 10th–8th cent. BC; h. 34.9 cm 
(35.5 cm including the tenons). This bronze statuette representing a  Phoenician/Egyptian deity was discovered 
in the sea between Sciacca and Selinunte 
(on the west coast of Sicily) at a depth of c.40 m in 1955. It was the object of a long legal procedure until it was acquired by 
the National Museum of Palermo after  
the court’s sentence of 1963.  We see a male figure in a classical Egyp-tian pose with the left leg forward, his right arm raised in the action of striking, the left forearm pointing forward. The torso is flat 
and schematic, while the lower part is ren-
dered with more plasticity and incised ana-
tomical detail. The skirt from waist to knee 
is clearly recognisable as an Egyptian shenti. The face is characterised by promi-nent ears and a long, pointed beard; the 
deep cavities for the eyes were originally 
filled with a different material, possibly glass paste. The head is crowned with a high tiara with ostrich plumes and a  
knob on top, a typical attribute of Osiris.  
This figure, Egyptian in origin, in the  Syrian and Canaanite pantheon represents the god of tempests, identified in turns with Hadad, Reshef, Melkart or Ba’al.  
In that region he was revered most widely 
from 1550 to 1200 BC.  On these grounds, the statuette has been variously dated between the fourteenth 
and twelfth centuries BC and its presence 
in the western Mediterranean attributed  to Mycenaeans or Phoenicians.  A thorough examination of possible  
parallels both in Near-Eastern and Western 
contexts has led Gioacchino Falsone to  believe that the statuette is ‘a Phoenician 
artefact in a pure Egyptianising style from 
the beginning of the first millennium BC’, to be identified as Reshef. This date  
obviously allows us to better place it in an 
historical context, making it a testimony to the probable passage of Phoenician ships 
through the western Mediterranean in the 
period just before the establishment of Phoenician colonies on Sicily’s west point.

EGYPTIAN TORSO FROM THE STAGNONE  
DI MARSALA  
Calcarenite, damage to the surface;  
reconstructed from several fragments, chipped along the fractures. 6th cent. BC; preserved height 1.27 m. 
The pieces were found in the lagoon  
(stagnone) of Marsala on Sicily’s west point in 1933. The Giornale di Sicilia of 23 July 1933 immediately recorded the discovery: 
‘As we have announced, some fishermen 
have recently found the torso of an athlete in the stretch of sea off Contrada Spagno-
la, along the Stagnone channel...’ 
The original statue was about 2.3–2.4 m high. It depicts a male figure wearing an Egyptian skirt (shenti) rendered with in-
cised vertical folds and kept up at the 
waist by a belt that is horizontal at the back and slightly arched in front. The right arm is alongside the body, with some air 
between it and the torso. The right hand is 
closed around a scroll; the fingers have been indicated with three deep grooves, 
the thumb is undefined. The left forearm 
lies over the chest, the hand closed over the breastbone. The anatomy of the torso is indicated with a few main lines and fluid transitions between planes. The shoulders are broad and robust. The lines of the  
skirt folds, lightly undulating at the back, 
indicate that the left leg was in front. The statue reproduces an Egyptian-style iconographic scheme known from various 
types of artefacts (statues, bronze statu-
ettes, ivory) found in various archaeologi-cal contexts in the Middle East and the 
western Mediterranean, dating from the 
eighth to sixth centuries BC. As to its original location, the statue has been connected to a stone architrave 
(beam) decorated with an Egyptian ogive 
(S-shaped ornamental frame) on all four sides, which was discovered during an  underwater survey of the lagoon around 
Mozia (see p. 24) conducted in the 1980s 
by a joint team from the universities of Ox-ford and Palermo and probably belongs to 
a two-column monument with an Egyptian 
nave.  Rossana De SimonePHOENICIANS IN SICILY"

 TRADE AND COLONISATION"
"39
The Greeks who sailed to Sicily and  
settled there from the eighth century 
BC onwards made an impressive impact 
on the history and landscape of the 
island as well as on Greek culture in general. The swift rise of the Greek cities and their extraordi-
nary rulers were celebrated with lasting monu-
ments in the Odes of Pindar (c.520–440 BC) as well as monuments and dedications in both Sicily 
and Panhellenic sanctuaries such as Delphi,  
while the often brutal exercise of power and the conflicts between rival tyrants and cities were 
examined by historians and philosophers. 
In Greek literature Sicily became a place of 
legend, home to divine powers and strange natural 
forces. Mount Etna was thought to be the home 
of the imprisoned monster T yphon; the dangerous 
straits dividing the island from Italy were identi-fied with the mythical hazards of Scylla and  
Charybdis (as in the Athenian philosopher Plato’s 
(427–347  BC) Seventh Letter). Indeed, the Athenian 
historiographer Thucydides (c.455 –400 BC) notes 
the belief that early inhabitants of Sicily included 
the Cyclopes and the Laestrygonians, mythical 
peoples encountered by Odysseus (as narrated by Homer in his Odyssey) on his travels, and observes 
that one of its human peoples, the Elymians, were 
descended from Trojan fugitives.
The stories of the foundations of the Greek  
cities, the rise of wealthy tyrants, the development 
of democracy, and eventual defeats by Cartha-
ginians and Romans, as well as their continuing  relationship with the eastern Greek world, were told by Sicily’s own historians: the fifth-century 
Antiochus of Syracuse, fourth-century Philistus  
of Syracuse, and third-century Timaeus of  Tauromenium. While little of their original texts survives, the histories of Diodorus Siculus — who 
wrote in the time of the Emperor Augustus and whose works were partly transmitted — draw from 
their writings. Thucydides himself used Antiochus’ 
history for his own Sicilian pre-history, while 
Polybius (c.200–120  BC) began his histories from 
the point where Timaeus’ account of Sicilian his-
tory left off. Timaeus was criticised for the rhetor-
ical and tragic excesses of his history, but the fre-quent reverses of Sicilian history lent themselves to dramatic portrayal, even by the usually austere 
Thucydides. 
The main Greek settlements were mostly  
clustered around the eastern and southern coasts of Sicily, but their influence spread far inland; the 
existing cultures of the Sicels, Sicans and Elymians, as well as that of Italic settlers, underwent a pro-cess of Hellenisation. But the Greeks did not  
provide the only cultural additions to the island: 
the west would be colonised by Carthaginians and during the settlement period there was little major 
friction between these groups at first. Herodotus 
(c.484–424 BC), the famous precursor to Thucy-
dides, reports stories of conflict between early Greek and Punic settlers, but this may represent  
a later justification for disputes between Greek 
and Carthaginian interests that arose as the Greek The Greeks 
         in SicilyCAROL ATACK
THE MOTYA CHARIOTEER 
Chariot-racing was a  
hugely popular sport in  
Antiquity, much like  Formula One nowadays.  The owners of the teams of 
horses generally employed 
charioteers rather than risking their own lives in this immensely dangerous 
sport. The Motya Chariot-
eer (or Motya Youth) is  one of the most remarka-
ble sculptures surviving 
from Antiquity because  of the exceptional skill of the workmanship and the  
unusual clinging garment 
that the young man wears. It is believed to be a Greek victor’s statue, represent-
ing the winner of a chariot 
race that took place some 2,500 years ago. The  
marble statue was found  
in 1979 during excavations of the Phoenician settle-ment on the tiny island of 
Motya (now Mozia) on the 
western tip of Sicily, and dates from c.480-460 BC.THE GREEKS IN SICILY"

SICILY AND THE SEA  TRADE AND COLONISATIONMOUNT ETNA AND NAXOS  
BAY FROM TAORMINA 
The city of Naxos was 
founded in 734 BC by Greek colonists from Chal-cis in Euboea. The memory 
of Naxos as the earliest of 
all the Greek settlements in Sicily was preserved by the dedication of an altar out-
side the town to Apollo  
Archegetes, the divine pa-tron under whose protec-tion the colonists had sailed; envoys going on missions to Greece, or returning to Sicily, offered 
sacrifices on this altar.  
Early in the 4th cent. BC,  a theatre was constructed in Tauromenium (now 
Taormina) overlooking the 
bay of Naxos and Mount Etna. The brick ruins date from the Roman period, 
when the theatre was

MINIATURE STAGE MASKS 
These miniature masks 
were copied from real 
stage masks that were used in the plays of the  so-called New Comedy. 
The subject-matter was 
mostly taken from family life and often involved  (unlikely) complicated  
love stories. These masks 
belong to regular types:  the young prostitute,  
Silenus, Pan, the older 
prostitute. Miniature stage masks, terracotta, h. 11.3–14.5 cm; 3rd–2nd cent. 
BC, Centoripa (Sicily).cities sought to expand their territories from the 
eighth century onwards. Greek victories such as the defeat of the Carthaginians at Himera, on  
Sicily’s north coast (480 BC), led to a period in 
which Greeks and Carthaginian settlements largely co-existed in peace. Conflict between Greeks of different loyalties, colonists from Dorian 
Corinth or Ionian Chalcis, would be at least as 
significant during the fifth century, until the resur-gence of Carthaginian power compelled the Greeks to find a greater sense of unity.
Cultural exchange between cities and popula-
tions was not restricted by the ‘epicracies’ or zones of influence that divided the islands; cult heroes 
and gods were syncretised (as with the Greek 
Hercules and Carthaginian Melkart at Selinus), and imagery from coins to statues — such as  
the Greek Y outh from Punic Motya — suggests 
further cultural mixture. 
While many eastern Greek cities went through 
a period of tyranny during the sixth century BC, in Sicily this development occurred later, continu-ing well into the fifth century BC and taking a more spectacular form. Ambitious individuals seized power for themselves and their families, overthrowing the original aristocracies of descend-
ants of founding families. Phalaris of Acragas (ruled 
over what is now Agrigento, c.570 –c.549) was later 
vilified for his extraordinary cruelty, with the claim that he roasted opponents inside a hollow bronze 
bull (as narrated by Pindar).
Theron of Acragas (ruled c.489–473 ) and  
the brothers Gelon (tyrant of Gela c.491 –478/7,  
of Syracuse 485 –478/7 BC) and Hieron (regent  
of Gela, 485 –478, tyrant of Syracuse 478 –66) rep-
resented a further flourishing of tyranny in the 
fifth century. Their style of rule was unlike that  
of earlier, Archaic Greek tyrants and more that  
of Eastern rulers such as Cyrus, the Persian ruler of the Achaemenid Empire. The depopulation and 
resettlement of cities became common; when 
Gelon moved his seat of power from Gela to  Syracuse, he took much of Gela’s population with 
him, while Hieron refounded Catana (modern 
Catania) as Aetna in 475 , moving its existing 
inhabitants to a depopulated Leontini (present-day Lentini) and establishing his son as ruler over the 
new population.

"43THE GREEKS IN SICILY
THEATRE OF SYRACUSE 
The Greek theatre of  
Syracuse, first built in  
the 5th cent. BC, is still  in use as a stage for  Classical Greek drama. 
This is a scene from the 
2010 performance of  Sophocles’ Ajax.The wealth of the tyrants was memorialised 
both in extravagant building projects and dedica-
tions in sanctuaries; their victories in the various 
Panhellenic games were the subject of odes such as Pindar’s first Pythian, which celebrates Hieron’s victory in the chariot race of 478  BC.
Sicilian tyranny fascinated Greek thinkers,  
both the poets of victory odes and fourth-century and later theorists. Xenophon (c.430 –354 BC), 
Thucydides’ successor as an historiographer, explored the attractions and limitations of the life of the tyrant in his Hieron, a dialogue in which the 
tyrant tells the poet Simonides how difficult life  
is for him, threatened on all sides and lacking the freedom or security of ordinary citizens. Simon-ides’ suggestion is a reformed life and self-trans-
formation into a kind and virtuous ruler; Plato’s 
Seventh Letter suggests philosopher-rulers and fair laws as an alternative to tyranny for Syracuse.
The attention paid to tyrants and tyranny 
should not detract attention from the scale and achievements of the Sicilian cities under the more varied forms of government that followed the 
swift collapse of the three great tyrannies in the 470s–60s. Sicily contributed many great thinkers 
and writers to the broader Greek world. Gorgias 
of Leontini (c.485 –380 BC) visited Athens both  
as an ambassador for his city in 427, seeking help 
as the city was threatened by the Syracusans, and as an orator and educator. He was famous for his paradoxical arguments, the claim that ‘Nothing 
exists’, and for rhetorical defences of mythical 
characters such as Helen and Palamedes. The democracy that developed at Syracuse after the 
death of Hieron created a demand for education 
in public speaking, just as it did in Athens; Sicilian rhetoricians were highly regarded. While Athenian 
playwrights visited to stage performances of their 
tragedies (Aeschylus (c.525 –456) is said to have 
died while visiting Gela and wrote Women of Aetna for performance in that city), the local dramatic 
tradition, especially the mythological comedies of 
Epicharmus (fl. 485 ), influenced Athenian theatre 
in its turn.
Gorgias was said to have been taught by Empe-
docles of Acragas (c.490 –430 BC), a philosopher 
whose theory of four roots or elements, and cos-mic cycles governed by the opposing forces of "

and polychrome figurative painting. On the lid of this 
vase the figure of a squat-

and became her grave gift

 Love and Strife, was set out in poems of which 
large fragments survive; his cosmological and  
scientific thought combined elements from Italic 
Pythagoreanism and Ionian science. Empedocles was also active in Acragas’ relatively brief period  of democratic government; it is tempting to see 
the influence of Sicilian politics in his theories  
of cosmic change. 
Although democratic Syracuse defeated the 
Athenian expedition in 415 –13 BC, demonstrating 
equal or greater strength in both land and sea-based warfare, its generals were distracted by  
pursuing revenge against the eastern Greeks and 
neglected the growing interest of Carthage in the island. While Greek and Carthaginian interests had largely co-existed since the defeat of the Carthag-
inians at Himera, the Greek cities came under 
fierce attack from 409 BC. Selinus, always on the edge of Greek influence, was captured, Acragas 
sacked, and Gela destroyed; remaining Greek 
interests were gathered together under a new tyrant of Syracuse, Dionysius I, in 406 BC. 
However, the process of political change con-
tinued; the tyranny of Dionysius II (ruled 367 –345 
BC) was interrupted by a period of exile in Italy, while a series of successors failed to consolidate 
power or resist the Carthaginians. Eventually the 
embattled Syracusans sought help from the mother city of Corinth, and General Timoleon

Syracuse resembling the rule of just law outlined in Plato’s Seventh Letter. But the final great leaders of Greek Sicily, Agathocles, tyrant of Syracuse

attachments for plumes and leather strips. Greek armour  
was typically distinctive during this period, often sporting

purposes. The photo on the right shows a diver taking the

ODYSSEUS AND POLYPHEMUS 
The 4th-cent. AD Villa  
del Casale near Piazza 
Armerina on Sicily is  famous for its stunning mosaics, which have 
earned it the status of  
UNESCO World Heritage Site. This mosaic shows  a scene from Homer’s  
story of Odysseus and the 
Cyclope, who is depicted with three eyes instead of 
one. Polyphemus is sitting 
in his cave, surrounded  by his sheep, while his captive Odysseus cunning-
ly offers him a huge cup  
of heady wine.In the ninth book of Homer’s Odyssey, Odysseus 
relates how he and his shipmates reached a 
wonderful island on their journeys: so fertile 
and bounteous as to need no cultivation. As it 
immediately turns out, however, this paradisiacal landscape unfortunately forms a stark contrast 
with the nature of its inhabitants, the Cyclopes.
Thence we sailed on, grieved at heart, and we came to the land of the Cyclopes, an 
arrogant and lawless folk, who, trusting in the immortal gods, plant nothing with their 
hands nor plough; but all these things spring 
up for them without sowing or ploughing, wheat, and barley, and vines, which bear the rich clusters of wine, and the rain of Zeus 
gives them increase. Neither assemblies for 
council have they, nor appointed laws, but they dwell on the peaks of lofty mountains 
in hollow caves, and each one is lawgiver to 
his children and his wives, and they have nothing to do with each other. (transl.  A.T. Murray)
Indeed, as Odysseus soon finds out to his  
horror, the Cyclopes are brutal man-eaters: several 
of Odysseus’ shipmates disappear in the monstrous 
belly of the giant Polyphemus, a son of Poseidon and the sea nymph Thoosa. What is worse, Polyphemus closes off his cave with a giant rock 
the mere humans can never hope to budge: they 
have become the monster’s prisoners. T o escape from the cave of the Cyclops, Odysseus cunningly 
gets the giant drunk on heady wine, and blinds his 
single eye with a burning stake. Clamped to the bellies of the giant’s sheep, Odysseus and his  shipmates regain their liberty. As they set sail, 
Odysseus famously answers to Polyphemus’  
queries that ‘Nobody’ (Outis) has blinded him. Due to his big ego, however, he cannot help but 
eventually reveal his real name to Polyphemus, 
who curses him and his crew. Most of the troubles Odysseus subsequently encounters are the result 
of this curse, through the wrath of Poseidon, 
Polyphemus’ father.
In later times, as ancient Greek scholars and 
adventurers tried to map Odysseus’ journeys, the 
isle of the Cyclopes was identified with the island 
of Sicily, with its mild climate and fertile volcanic soil. Indeed, allegorising readers recognised in the 
volcano Etna the rock-throwing, one-eyed giant, 
huge as a mountain top, the fearful Polyphemus, blinded in his single eye by Odysseus. This pro-ductive association spawned many literary refer-
ences in later Greek literature, such as the satyr-
play Cyclops by the Classical Athenian playwright Euripides (480–406 BC). In this comic dramatic 
piece, which essentially retells the episode from 
the Odyssey, some of the traits that were already attributed to the monster by Homer (his boorish-ness, his inability to keep his liquor down) are 
elaborated in burlesque style, especially through 
the addition of a bunch of boozy satyrs and  Silenus, who are the comic slaves of Polyphemus.Sicily, Land of

At a slightly later stage, two Sicily-based poets, 
Philoxenus (435 /34–380/79 BC) and Theocritus 
(third century BC), took these burlesque and 
bucolic elements one step further, providing the myth of the one-eyed cannibal Polyphemus with  a remarkable and unexpected turn: a love interest. 
Philoxenus was a dithyrambist, a composer of 
songs for drinking and dancing parties, who for a time resided at the court of the tyrant Dionysius I 
of Syracuse (ruled 406–367  BC). If we are to be- 
lieve the outrageous and malicious gossip in the 
ancient Greek historiographers (Timaeus, Dio-
dorus Siculus — see Atack’s article — and Plutarch 
(47–120 AD)), this ruler behaved like a prefigura-
tion of Rome’s mad emperor Nero. It is likely that aristocratic ill-will and the generic hate of tyranny 
are to blame for much of the bad press Dionysius gets. However this may be, we see that like Nero, 
Dionysius was considered a paranoid despot. His two wives were always subjected to a full body 
search before they were allowed to cross the draw-
bridge that led to his bedroom. If his hair needed cutting, this task fell to his daughter, who was obliged to use heated walnut shells to singe the 
hairs: scissors or knives were strictly forbidden.  
His encounter with the venerable philosopher Plato allegedly led to his selling the latter off as  
a slave, with the sarcastic justification that ‘as a 
philosopher he would be free in any situation.’ The famous story of the sword, finally, hung on a 
horse’s hair above the head of one Damocles, who 
had wondered aloud what it would feel like to be a tyrant, vividly captures the feelings of fear and suspicion that must have haunted Dionysius.

bad. Indeed, his death was said to fulfil the ora-
cle that he would ‘die once he had been victo-
rious over his betters.’
Despite all this, Dionysius was inordinately 
proud of his writings and wished to have the 
experts’ opinions on it. One day he asked 
Philoxenus, the poet, what he thought of a certain poem he had recently composed. 
Philoxenus answered that he did not admire it 
at all, a verdict which so enraged Dionysius that he sent him directly to the quarries. Later, 
repenting, he let Philoxenus return, and after a Like Nero, too, Dionysius was also a passionate 
poet, who composed — as far as we are able to 
make out today from the few meagre fragments 
that remain — tragedies in an unusual and experi-
mental style. He apparently chose, for instance,  to compose a tragedy on the death of his wife 
Doris. Tragedy on autobiographical themes was 
completely unknown in ancient Greece. Written on a more traditional topic, Hector’s Ransom, how -
ever, won Dionysius a first prize at the prestigious Lenaea festival in Athens, a victory he is said to have doused in so much wine that he expired.  
The general judgement seems nonetheless to have 
LITTLE MONSTER ON THE ROOF  
Antefix, decorated with a Gorgon’s head.  
Terracotta, 550–500 BC; h. 50 cm, l. 40 cm.  
In November 2012 a very interesting find was made in the sea near Gela, off the coast of  Contrada Bulala: a terracotta antefix, the orna-
mental end of a roof tile (kalypter), decorated 
with a Gorgon’s head (gorgoneion). Such archi-tectural terracottas were usually meant for the decoration of sanctuaries. This is a small speci-
men; part of the tile has been preserved. The 
relief was made in a mould. This type of antefix with Gorgon head is known from the Archaic 
period. The tradition was Corinthian; the Gor -
gon’s head was believed to ward off evil. The  
relief depicts a monstrous face with chubby cheeks, big almond-shaped eyes, and a mouth 
with the corners pointing up and showing the 
teeth, the tongue hanging out and painted red. The hair has been modelled into curls descend-ing on both sides of the face in two rows that are separated from the rest of the undulating mass of hair by a fillet on the forehead. By comparison with a kalypter with gorgoneion 
that is very similar in type and style, the antefix 
can be dated to the second half of the sixth century BC. The other kalypter was discovered during the excavation of ‘Building VI’ in Gela,  
a sanctuary on the east part of the acropolis 
where many such roof decorations with Gorgon heads were found.  
The type of gorgoneion antefix that was made in 
the workshops of Gela was very common in the Archaic period. Over time its style evolved: the type with terrifying and beast-like features was 
replaced by one in which the Gorgons have 
softer faces and there are tiaras and rosettes  in their hair, although they still have a certain expressive vitality.  
Ceramic covers, originally meant to protect the wooden structure of the roof, gradually acquired 
a decorative function. They attest to the pres-ence in Sicily of technically advanced and flour -
ishing crafts that were very creative and original 
in their elaboration of decorative systems im-
ported from Greece. Syracuse, Naxos, Selinus, Leontini, and Gela are the Siceliot cities that have yielded numerous finds of architectural 
terracottas.  
Especially in Gela, as the results of the excava-tions show, the ceramic workshops were lively 
and productive. Imported models were elaborat-
ed autonomously, creating original solutions; the artefacts prove their makers’ particular skill and creativity. The production of antefixes in the 
workshops of Gela covered a time span from  
the second half of the sixth century to 282 BC, when the city was destroyed.

the seashore. We might think that this story is 
charming and ingenious enough in its own right, 
but the fact that it was apparently conceived as a 
literary charade adds to its pique: for Polyphemus we are invited to read Dionysius, whose unsuccess-ful suit of a courtesan, here embodied by Galatea, 
was thus ridiculed by Philoxenus. The poet appar-
ently cast himself as Odysseus, the successful suitor of the nymph, who by his false advice frustrates 
Polyphemus’ attempts to win her over. The insults 
could not have been more economically com-pounded: to be called Polyphemus meant being 
cast as a violent and boorish monster, and now also 
as an unsuccessful lover and utterly wretched poet.while asked him once more for his opinion on 
another poem. Without a word, Philoxenus 
stretched out his arms and asked to be led directly to the quarries again.  
It seems this stroke of wit amused Dionysius 
enough to leave Philoxenus unscathed.
Nevertheless, apparently irritated by these and 
similar experiences, Philoxenus wrote a poem enti-tled Cyclops, in which he presents the cannibal 
monster of the Odyssey in the guise of a lovesick shepherd. Polyphemus has fallen in love with the elusive sea nymph Galatea, who teases him and 
flees into her own element whenever he app ro a-
ches. T o win her over, the monster sings, sitting on 
CERAMIC BOAT 
Brown-pink clay, hand-modelled and painted  
in white, traces of pink and light blue. Late 3rd 
cent. BC; h. 15 cm, l. 46.5 cm, w. 12 cm.  Syracuse, Fusco, necropolis Tor di Conte,  tomb 346 (excavated in 1977).  
Model of a boat, its prow shaped like the head 
of a pistrix, a mythical sea monster with a  gaping mouth, big bulging eyes, pointed ears and a crest. The stern ends in a long fish tail 
held high. The boat is wide and rounded, the 
profiled keel visible on the outside and marked on the inside by the junction groove. The five 
rowers have dog-like faces and are seated in 
two lines; the sixth rower has been lost, but his seat is still there. In the centre the place for the foot of the mast is visible: a small hollow 
cylinder in relief, placed a little toward the 
bow, as it was in real boats. Four small rostra (battering-rams) are attached to the ends of the hull. One of the sides shows traces of  
decorative paint: a brown band with a winding 
vine painted on it in white. The find was one of the gifts in a grave that 
was originally made for an adult and reused 
for the burial of a female child. Among the  other objects in the grave were a so-called clipeus (a medallion-shaped portrait) with a  
female bust painted over it, an iron pair of  
toiletry scissors and, most importantly, a bronze coin minted at Syracuse. The latter made it possible to date the burial to the end 
of the third century BC.  
In all, some twenty of these boat models are known, most of them originating from the  
Siceliot world, showing Syracusan influence, 
and dating from the third and second centu-ries BC. They were probably manufactured at   
 
Syracuse, because of the common character -
istics of clay and paint and because they have 
been found in the waste of the city’s furnaces. 
The boat models were mainly found in funer -
ary contexts, but also in places meant for  
votive gifts. 
As to their meaning, there are various interpre-
tations. They have been explained as objects deposited for their value in reality, in which 
case the owner-deceased had to be a sailor or 
someone otherwise connected to ships. They have been interpreted as toys; their symbolic 
value has been underlined, connected to 
transporting the soul in the afterlife in the con-text of the Isis-Persephone cult that flourished  
at the time. Recently a fourth hypothesis has come up, supposing a connection to mythical and literary events, long ago as well, and ac-
cording to which it is useless to look for the 
matrix of this type of boat, which can be traced back to trade vessels with the sail but also to 
the military version with the rowers. It is a 
product of the imagination: the prow with the    crocodile mouth and the pointed ears and 
bristling crest of a wild boar represents a fan-
tasy animal that is also found in depictions of mythical and heroic ship travels on vases from  
the seventh and sixth centuries BC. It can therefore be interpreted as a toy, which indeed lay in the tomb of a child, but animated by the 
story of an adult referring to popular stories, as 
it also happens in the Sicilian Opera dei Pupi 
(puppet theatre), recounting stories from the 
French Middle Ages.

Of course, none of this works, and we even 
start to wonder whether Galatea is not a figment 
of the Cyclops’ imagination. Different from the 
satirical portrayal by Philoxenus, Theocritus’ 
deluded monster makes us smile in recognition, not disdain: who, indeed, has not been in the  
position of the gauche and rejected young 
Polyphemus, hopelessly bewitched and painfully half-aware of his shortcomings? ‘But he found the 
cure, and fared better than if he had paid gold,’  
so the poet Theocritus tells us, for: ‘No more  powerful medicine against love is there than the nine Muses.’ And so the Cyclops ‘shepherds his 
love’ and sings to the deaf ears of the sea nymph, 
to himself, and to an appreciative audience of amused readers through the ages, willing to cast  
a glance into Theocritus’ distorting mirror.This poem, and its conception of Polyphemus 
as a desperate and unrequited lover, was to enjoy great success in Greek and Latin poetry. The  
Hellenistic Syracusan poet Theocritus reworked the story in his eleventh Idyll, which is one of the most charming and sympathetic renderings to  
survive until this day. In it the incongruous por-
trait of Polyphemus as a clumsy young shepherd in love is fleshed out with details like the Cyclops’ 
naïve offer to Galatea that she can have any quan-
tity of goat cheese she wishes, his recognition that it must be his hairy eyebrow and flat nose that 
frighten her, and the desperate wish that he might 
grow gills, in order to be with his obscure object of desire. Indeed, in a series of subtle intertextual allusions Polyphemus unwittingly forecasts his 
own future, telling Galatea that she may burn his 
single eye if she so chooses, and wishing that a stranger might come to his island… to teach him 
how to swim. Finally he claims that if Galatea  "

Sicily has long been renowned for the  
fertility of its soil. Thus, in the Middle 
Ages, the Normans, who had conquered 
England in the battle of Hastings in 1066  
and taken Palermo in 1071  in their struggle to end 
Moorish occupation, valued Sicily as a property 
paramount to England. Its fertile ground was an 
important asset in a chiefly agrarian world, par-ticularly when the Mediterranean had begun to 
enjoy a fair degree of economic unity. Having 
served as a source of grain and other foodstuffs  for the Aegean world from about 700 BC on -
wards, Sicily became Rome’s main granary when 
the fall of Syracuse in 212  BC brought the island 
into its empire. This caused a shift of economic and political activity from the south and east 
coasts of the island to Panormus (Palermo),  
centre of the northern coast.
It is no surprise, therefore, that Demeter, 
Mother Earth, should have been Sicily’s most  venerated deity. Both Syracuse, at the Cyane wells (as Diodorus Siculus, first century BC, tells us in his World History), and Enna claimed to have been 
the scene of the abduction of Persephone or Kore, 
Demeter’s daughter, by Hades into the under-world. Zeus, ruler of the gods, was said to have 
given Sicily to Kore for a wedding gift.
Demeter’s feast, the Thesmophoria, was held in 
late October, marking Kore’s return to the upper 
world. It was a sowing feast, lasting three days in 
Athens. There the first day, that of the anabasis 
(‘ascent’), saw a procession to the Thesmophorion, Demeter 
      on SicilyKEES NEEFT
the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore. During the 
second day, the Nesteia (‘fast’), the women joined 
Demeter in her mourning for Kore. On the third 
day, the Kalligeneia (‘bearer of beautiful offspring’, one of Demeter’s names), the goddess was asked for fecundity of soil and female body through 
offerings and feasts in her honour. On this day, 
‘Drawers’, old women who were forbidden to have sexual intercourse during the six days before 
the festival, dragged up from cellars (megara) and 
pits the remains of piglets that had been left to  
rot for some time. These remains were then added 
to the seeds as a fertiliser.
Generally speaking, the Thesmophoria were a 
feast for women only, a mystery cult about which 
one was not allowed to talk. Moreover, the farther 
north and west one comes in the ancient Greek 
world, the less written evidence will be available. Not only did the peripheral Greeks probably 
write less, but their state bureaucracy also pro-
duced much less epigraphical material. Moreover, our knowledge of the ancient Greek world is  limited because it greatly depends on Alexandrian 
scholarship, which — apart from Homer and the 
Archaic poets — focused mainly on the Athenian 
literature of the fifth and fourth centuries. Thus, there are only scraps of written information  
dealing with the Thesmophoria on Sicily. They  tell us, among other things, that the festival lasted ten days in Syracuse, that men somehow took  
part in it at Acragas (present-day Agrigento) and 
probably at the Cyane wells near Syracuse too.

Grieving over the loss of 
her daughter, Demeter travelled the world in the guise of an old woman  
and was kindly received by 
the queen of Eleusis. Upon leaving the palace, the goddess gave the eldest 
prince, Triptolemus, an ear 
of grain and taught him the art of ploughing and sow-
ing, asking him to spread  
it all over the world. Plaster cast of a marble bas-relief from the Eleusinian sanc-

Furthermore, that cakes made of sesame and 
honey and shaped like female genitals, called mylloi 
all over Sicily, were carried along during the main 
ceremony in Syracuse.
Excavations have brought to light several Sicil-
ian sanctuaries identifiable as Thesmophoria by 
architectural features, by graffiti found there, or  
by the type of votive gifts, mainly terracottas. The only ‘Athenian-style’  Thesmophorion, with pits 
for the deposition of piglets, has been identified  
at Agrigento, at the western end of its temple hill.
Six of the other sanctuaries are conspicuous for 
their locations close to the sea. Four of these are sit-uated on the banks of rivers, generally close to their mouths. Such is the case with the Bitalemi sanctu-ary just east of Gela, the Malophoros sanctuary west 
of Selinus, the sanctuary at Santa Anna near 
Agrigento, and one at Catania. T wo others, one at Helorus, the other at Locri in nearby Cala bria, are 
located directly on the seaside
. Graf fiti identify four 
out of these six sanctuaries as Thesmophoria; the 
other two are those at Santa Anna and Helorus. Whereas these graffiti date from the fifth  
century BC, but imported Corinthian pottery in 
the bottom layers enables us to trace veneration  at the sites back to c.600  BC.
 The divine blessing  
of fertility always being in demand, veneration to 
obtain it must somehow have existed at earlier 
times as well. The question then arises where  such activity had taken place previously.
As continuity was of paramount importance  
to cult practice, certainly in the field of fertility, one should first scrutinise the possibility of Thesmo-
phoria having been used in the same vein before.  
The topographical characteristics of these sites may provide a clue here. Setting foot ashore on foreign soil, colonists would immediately were to make 
expiatory sacrifices to appease the gods of the land. 
The Demeter sanctuaries mentioned above are located exactly where one would expect such foundation offerings to have taken place: on river 
banks close to the sea or, in the absence of a river, 
on the seaside, with the sail directions from behind pointing to the future settlements just ahead."

THE EUPLOIA ANCHOR 
Movable lead anchor stock.  
Cast lead, 5th–4th cent. BC; l. 80 
cm, h. 8 cm. ‘I have no idea which way the winds are going, waves are rolling in from 
every side, we are dragged to the 
open sea with the black ship, suffer -
ing hardships in the great storm; in fact (...) we cast the anchors, the 
rudders and sheets remain fixed in 
the ropes and that could save me in any case; and the smashed cargo, 
some of it is tossed high...’ Those 
are the words of the Greek poet  Alcaeus of Mytilene (fl. c.600 BC), describing the experience of a  
tempest at sea and using the word 
ankyra (anchor) for the first time that we know of. In the course of the centuries anchors have developed 
from simple stone weights connect-
ed to the ship by leather straps to the anchors of lead, a flexible and 
resistant material, from Hellenistic-
Roman times. In the autumn of 2004, officers of the Nucleo Tutela  Patrimonio Culturale (the military-
police unit for the protection of  
cultural heritage) recovered the movable stock of an anchor at 150 m off Cala Rotonda on the island of 
Favignana near Sicily’s west point. 
One of its ends bears the Greek in-scription ‘Euploia’. Cala Rotonda near Marettimo is a natural harbour and one of the most sheltered inlets 
on the Aegadian Islands. The pres-
ence of inscriptions and apotropaic (warding off evil) or decorative sym-bols on lead anchor stocks is wide-
spread in the ancient world. They 
may refer to the ship’s name, to the shipyard or shipowner, or to the dei-ty to whom the anchor was dedicat-
ed. ‘Euploia’ refers to Aphrodite in  
her role as protectress at sea:  as goddess of the sea and the heav-
ens, she was invoked with the epi-
thets Euploia (Lady of Good Sailing), Epilimenia (Lady of the Harbour), and Pontia (Lady of the Sea). Sanc-
tuaries dedicated to Aphrodite rose 
up near the most important ports. The most ancient one was that of Naucratis, great trade centre in the 
Nile Delta, established c.600 BC.  
Aphrodite’s temple in Cnidus  (on the coast of Asia Minor, present-
day Turkey) is famous for its cult 
statue made by Praxiteles. From Sicily no other anchors are known with the name Euploia, but there are 
anchors with names of other gods: 
one to Hercules, and one to Venus and Jupiter. Decorative motifs such  as dolphins and shells may also re-
fer to the cult of the goddess; espe-
cially the widespread knucklebone motif on anchors is connected to the ‘Venus throw’, the highest throw in the game of knucklebones, which 
was similar to dice and highly  
popular in Antiquity. Sailors not only invoked Aphrodite Euploia for her benevolence toward ships and ports, 
but also while they cast anchor.

ANCHOR STOCK 
The earliest anchors were 
rocks, baskets of stones 
and the like, but they  soon evolved into the form still familiar to us: with a 
straight horizontal stock 
(often made of stone or lead, while the vertical part, the shank, was made of 
wood) and bent arms 
equipped with flukes for  a better grip. Anchor  
stock, lead, l. 83.5 cm;  
1st cent. AD. A SAILOR’S VOTIVE OFFERING In Antiquity sailing was  
far riskier than nowadays; 
the gods had to be propiti-ated with votive offerings. These little anchors were 
probably made for this pur -
pose and may well have 
been offered to Neptune. Two votive anchors, lead,

ANCHOR ON A SHIELD This fragment of a Greek 
vase shows a round shield 
with an anchor painted on it. Ceramic, 5.5 x 5.5 cm, late 6th cent. BC. At first sight, Gela will seem an exception,  
the Bitalemi sanctuary being located on the right 
bank, the future city on the left bank. The descrip-
tion of the arrival of the Greeks in Sicily by the Greek historiographer Thucydides (c.455 –400 BC) 
however makes it clear that the colonists arriving 
at the location of Gela in 688  BC joined an al  rea-
 dy existing settlement. Other evidence also sug-
gests that this settlement lay on the right bank, the 
‘modern’ city apparently being the result of a later 
relocation. As the population gradually spread into the hinterland and towards sub-colonies, other 
Thesmophoria are likely to have been created 
over time, as the cases of Gela, Acragas, and Syra-cuse show.
As stated above, pottery started to arrive at 
these sanctuaries c.600  BC, not only in Sicily,  
but also in Locri and probably its sub-colony  Hipponium (modern Vibo Valentia) in Calabria 
and in Cyrene and its sub-colony T ocra in the 
Cyrenaica (Libya). This brings us to the question which form the veneration had had before. Most likely, it consisted in offerings of the fruits of the 
fields. The pottery — generally Corinthian and 
local products at first — consisted of pouring and 
drinking vessels for use during the sojourn and, mostly, oil flasks and scented-water vessels for 
votive offerings. T owards the middle of the sixth century, they were more and more often accom-panied by east-Greek oil flasks with their upper 
parts shaped as dedicants and by terracottas show-
ing either deities or dedicants, both flasks and  terracottas being mould-made. At the very end of 
this period, aes rude, a kind of primitive money, 
and bullion also found its way into the sanctuaries. After 550  BC, the picture changed profoundly. 
Corinthian pottery then gave way almost com-pletely to east-Greek, Laconian, and Attic imports, even though mould-made terracottas, now local products, were deemed to serve Demeter’s 
demand better. Most of these terracottas show a 
dedicant with piglet; to a lesser extent, deities also occur. Modest buildings were erected and, in the 
fifth century, lamps testify to nocturnal activities. 
For Syracuse, it has been established that cult activities continued into late Antiquity."

The world’s first coins were produced in 
Asia Minor in the second half of the sev-
enth century BC. The city-states (poleis) 
in mainland Greece began minting their 
own coins c.550  BC, after which the production 
and use of coinage spread rapidly throughout the 
Greek world. By 500 BC, coins were being pro-
duced not only in Greece but also in Italy, south-ern France, Sicily, the Greek parts of the Persian 
Empire and Cyrenaica in northern Africa. One 
factor that may have played an important role in their rapid spread was the pride citizens felt in the 
identity of their own polis — an identity that was 
closely associated with local myths, symbols and 
landscapes. The long-standing rivalry between these city-states meant that they were constantly 
looking for new ways to affirm their respective 
identities. Coins provided the perfect medium, since these small metal objects could be used to 
display symbols reflecting that identity.
Perhaps surprisingly, the sea played a compara-
tively minor role in the visual language of Greek coins from Sicily, many of which depict gods asso-ciated with the island’s springs and rivers. These 
figures are often shown next to local fauna and/or agricultural produce. They reflect the fertility of the lands inhabited by the Greeks and were used 
as symbols to express the specific identity of the 
Sicilian poleis. While the sea may have been less visible on the coins, it nevertheless played a vital 
role in the trade and shipping that supplied the 
metal from which they were made. Some of this metal came from Spain, and the Greek cities on 
Sicily exported agricultural produce such as grain, 
wine and olive oil to the east, for which they were paid in silver coins (among other forms of remu-neration) from Athens, Corinth, and Aegina. Coins 
from these poleis have certainly been found in 
hoards from the sixth century BC, when the first coins were also struck on Sicily itself. 
The city-state of Naxos, which was founded  
in 734  BC, was the earliest Greek colony on Sicily 
and among the first Sicilian cities to produce coins. Naxos had a port that was favourably situ-PAUL BELIËN

ated for vessels plying the waters between Italy 
and Sicily. The same applied to the strategically 
located port of Zancle, another early colony (pre-
sent-day Messina). The name Zancle comes from zanklon, the indigenous Sicilian word for ‘sickle’, and refers to the distinctive shape of its har-
bour — the basis of the city’s wealth. This sickle 
shape can be seen on the earliest coins used by the 
city. By contrast, the wealth of Leontini (modern 
Lentini), in the southeast of the island, derived 
from the produce grown in the fertile plains of  its hinterland and was less dependent on a port 
and access to the sea. The coins produced in 
Leontini show a lion’s head — a word-play on  
its name, which contains the word ‘lion’ (leont-) —  surrounded by grains of barley representing the 
rich harvest of its fields. 
The rivers and springs that were so vital to the 
island’s fertility and hence the prosperity of the Greeks appear on coins in the form of river gods 
and nymphs. In fact, many of the Greek colonies on Sicily were named after local springs or rivers. The Greek pantheon of deities contains an almost 
limitless number of water gods, and every spring, 
river and stream was believed to be the habitation of a nymph or river god. The oldest and best-
known was Achelous, father of all rivers — and of 
all nymphs, according to Homer. In Greek 
mythology, he would assume the form of a bull (with or without a human head) or a snake. His 
many guises may have been intended to reflect the 
fluid nature of water, the fluctuation of river levels and the meandering course of rivers. This muta-
bility and fluidity is reflected in the different ways in which river gods are depicted on Sicilian coins.
The river that gave its name to the city of Gela 
is often shown on the coins of this polis as a bull 
with a human head. The river god Crimisus, by contrast, appears as a dog, in the guise of which he seduced the Trojan princess Aegesta. Their son, 
Aegestes, was said to have founded the cities of 
Egesta (present-day Segesta), Eryx (now Erice) and Entella in western Sicily. These were inhabited 
by the Elymians, a people of non-Greek origin 
who may have originated on the eastern Mediter-ranean seaboard. So perhaps the mythological ori-
gins of Egesta contain a grain of truth that refers 
to this people. On coins from the polis of Selinus, 
the river god from which it took its name is often shown standing at an altar in human form, making 
an offering for the prosperity of the city and its 
residents. The leaf above the cult image of the bull is another common representation of Selinus. The 
leaf is the wild celery (selinon) and refers both to 
the name of the polis and to the eponymous river.

Another such example can be seen on the 
coinage of Catana, present-day  
Catania, which in 476  BC was conquered by 
Hieron I of Syracuse. Following its capture, the 
city was renamed Aetna, the indigenous popula-tion was banished and Syracusans and colonists 
from the Peloponnese moved in to replace them. 
In 461  BC, the original inhabitants managed to 
reconquer their city and restored the original 
name. The coin shown here is thought to date 
from the period following the reconquest. The obverse depicts the local river god, the bull Ame-
nanus, who is shown pounding the ground with 
his hooves on the verge of charging. On the reverse is Nike, the winged goddess of victory.On the first coins issued by the city, the leaf shape fills the entire obverse face.
Another example of the clever imagery used on 
these ‘talking designs’ (otherwise known as types parlants or canting badges) is the crowing cockerel heralding a new day (hemera) on the obverse of the coins issued by the city of Himera. The reverse 
originally depicted a hen, but when in 480 BC 
Himera fell under the control of the powerful city of Acragas, the hen was replaced by the Acragan 
symbol of a crab. The weight standard against 
which the coins were struck was also adapted to that used in Acragas. The coins from Himera thus 
reflect the political and military changes that 
affected the city.

Most of the coins shown here are made of  
silver and are relatively heavy, making them more 
suitable for larger payments. The value of these 
coins was effectively determined by the quantity  
of silver they contained. For lower-value payments, 
coins containing far less silver needed to be struck. 
The extremes to which this could be taken are  
evidenced by the minuscule coins that have been 
found. The smallest known Greek coin weighs only 
0.04 grammes. Unsurprisingly, these tiny silver 
pieces, some of them no bigger than a pin-head, 
were difficult to use. Although the Greeks did use purses, sources from Antiquity tell us that people 
also kept small change in their mouths. They  
evidently sometimes swallowed them by mistake, 
which is probably why such coins are occasionally Nymphs also played an important role in the

many of the city’s coins. Dolphins are shown 
swimming around her head to symbolise the fresh water spring surrounded by the salty ocean. Unu-

was famous even in Antiquity and was imitated 
throughout the Greek world. Whereas the major-ity of Greek silver coins weighed no more than  17 grammes, this piece is nearly 43 grammes. Why 
such exceptional coins were struck is unknown. One possibility is that they were made to pay for

of a coin and the value of the metal it was made

bronze coins for a specific quantity of silver coins.

INTRODUCTION 
‘Speech is a powerful master.’ The Greek sophist 
who formulated this observation on the persuasive 
force of language was Gorgias (c.485—380 BC), a 
native of Leontini on Sicily (now Lentini). It is well known that the art of persuasion was of great importance in Classical Greece. The citizens of 
Greek poleis or city-states were used to presenting 
their speeches in the law courts, in the assembly and on ceremonial occasions. Speakers needed 
training: rhetoric, the art of persuasive speech, 
developed rapidly and became an essential part  of Greek education. While Athens was the centre 
of oratory in the late fifth and fourth centuries 
BC, Sicily played a crucial role in the early history of rhetoric. As many as four different natives of Sicily were honoured by ancient sources as the 
‘inventor’ of rhetoric: the famous duo Corax and 
Tisias of Syracuse, the philosopher Empedocles  of Acragas, and the sophist Gorgias of Leontini.  
In Greek cultural memory, the birth of rhetoric 
was thus strongly associated with the island of  Sicily. This essay, which follows the traditional division of a classical speech into four parts as  
the Sicilian teachers recommended, will discuss 
the relationship between Sicily and rhetoric. The narrative will summarise the traditional story of 
the birth of rhetoric in Sicily; the argument will 
critically examine that story in the light of recent research; the epilogue will establish the role of Sicily in the history of rhetoric.CASPER C. DE JONGE
Sicily and the 
   Birth of Rhetoric
NARRATIVE
The traditional story of the birth of rhetoric 
focuses on two important events in the fifth  
century BC. The first event took place in 466 BC, 
when the citizens of Syracuse revolted against their tyrant Thrasybulus. Having established a democracy, the citizens had to be able to present 
their views in the assembly. A certain Corax (the 
name means ‘crow’) taught them how to speak effectively. According to a different version of  
the story, the instructions of Corax focused not  
on political but on judicial speeches. The tyrants of Syracuse had taken possession of the properties  
of its citizens, who now had to plead their cause before court. One student of Corax was Tisias, who supposedly defined rhetoric as ‘the craftsman of persuasion’. The first handbook of rhetoric was 
written either by Tisias or by Corax, or by both 
men together. These rhetoricians taught that a speech should be divided into four parts.
A famous story is told about the relationship 
between teacher and student. When Tisias became Corax’ student, he promised that he would pay his tuition when he had won his first lawsuit. When 
he had completed his course, Tisias refused to pay. 
So Corax took his student to court. In front of the jury, Tisias argued that he did not have to pay his 
tuition. If he won the dispute, he would not have 
to pay by that decision; if he lost, he would not have to pay either, because then he would have lost his first case. Corax replied by reversing the

argument. The members of the jury did not 
appreciate their clever argumentations. They threw the opponents out of court, describing them as ‘a 
bad egg from a bad crow!’
The second important moment in the early 
history of rhetoric occurred forty years later. In 427 BC an embassy from the Sicilian town of 
Leontini came to Athens in order to ask for  military protection against Syracuse. Gorgias was THE ORATOR 
Statesmen and other  
public figures were often immortalised as orators at the beginning of a speech, gesturing for silence. This

Athenian assembly had an enormous impact, 
because of its innovative use of poetic language and 
figures of speech. Gorgias enchanted the Athenians, who decided to send military support to Leontini. Of course, there had been eloquent speakers in 
Athens prior to the arrival of Gorgias, but his artis-
tic use of language had a lasting impact on Greek prose style. In his Encomium of Helen, a praise of the 
mythical Helen whose abduction by Paris started 
the Trojan War, Gorgias describes speech (logos) as ‘a powerful master’. He argues that Helen was not 
guilty of the war between Greeks and Trojans, since 
she was either seduced by love or enchanted by the persuasive speech of her lover Paris. Not everyone appreciated Gorgias’ bombastic style and relativism. 
Plato (427– 347 BC) attacked the rhetorician in a 
work called Gorgias. The philosopher seems to have 
written this dialogue when he had returned from his first visit to Sicily. 
ARGUMENT
Recent scholarship has questioned the traditional account of the birth of rhetoric in Sicily. The 
work of Thomas Cole (1991 ) and Edward  
Schiappa (1999 ) has been especially important. 
They show that the story of Corax and Tisias is 
largely based on a number of texts from late 
Antiquity and the Byzantine period, the so-called 
Prolegomena. These late accounts do not agree  with the early sources, including Plato and Aristo-
tle (fourth century BC). There are two important 
differences. Firstly, Plato and Aristotle say almost nothing about Corax, while assigning a modest 
role to Tisias. Secondly, the theories that late 
sources attribute to Corax and Tisias are associated with different men in Plato and Aristotle. The story of the dispute between teacher and student, 
for instance, is told about the sophist Protagoras 
(c.485–416 BC) and his pupil Euathlus. Plato 
attributes the definition of rhetoric as ‘craftsman of persuasion’ not to Corax or Tisias, but to  Gorgias. And the division of a speech into four parts may in fact have been the invention of  
Isocrates or Theodectes, both fourth-century 
Athenian orators.
According to Plato and Aristotle, the early 
teachers of rhetoric in Sicily were mainly  "

recognise that rhetorical theories were formulated 
much earlier: some ancient Egyptian texts (dating 
from 2200 to 150 0  BC) reflect on the power of 
speech and communication. However, neither the 
Egyptian theories nor the Homeric observations on speech constitute a systematic doctrine. Hence 
Classical Greece could still claim the development 
of rhetoric as a separate discipline. We may con-clude that Sicilian rhetoricians played an impor-
tant — but somewhat obscure — role in the early 
development of that new discipline.
But why Sicily? Let us consider two possible 
answers. A first answer is that of the first-century 
BC Roman rhetorician Cicero (Brutus 46,  summarising Aristotle). Tracing the early history  of rhetoric, he states that the Sicilians ‘were very 
quick and acute and had a natural turn for contro-
versy’. No surprise that Greek men with these qualities became the first rhetoricians! Andreas 
Willi (2008) presents a different answer. On the 
one hand, the Sicilian Greeks strove for independ-ence from their mother cities on the mainland. On the other hand, they came into contact with 
local people: this may have refined their linguistic 
skills, but it may also have stimulated them to adopt a more relativistic, egalitarian, and perhaps 
democratic attitude. This background would at 
least partially account for the Sicilian interest in rhetoric. 
The overthrow of the tyranny in Syracuse  
(466 BC) and the performance of Gorgias in  Athens (427 BC) have become symbolic events  in the narrative of early rhetoric. It is a good story, 
which not only casts light on the relationship 
between Sicily and Athens, but also offers a plau-sible explanation for the rapid development of 
Greek rhetoric by making a connection between 
democracy, oratory and rhetoric. In Greece the  art of speech-making developed into a highly sophisticated discipline, which was passed on to 
the Romans and then to the modern world. 
Rhetoric can be considered one of the greatest achievements of the Greeks; and Sicily is the lieu 
de mémoire that reminds us of the early history of 
this important discipline.interested in arguments of probability, which are 
especially useful in the context of law courts:  
the teachings of Tisias of Syracuse seem to have focused on arguments to be used in forensic speeches. His ‘handbook’ was probably not a theo-
retical treatise but a collection of fictive examples 
that could be used in particular situations. But who was Corax? In the early sources he is a rather 
shadowy figure; some scholars doubt that he ever 
existed. Perhaps Corax and Tisias were in fact one and the same person: Tisias, also known as ‘the 
Crow’.
EPILOGUE
Was rhetoric born in the fifth century BC on  
the island of Sicily? The answer to that question 
depends on our definition of rhetoric. Some 
scholars are willing to date the origins of rhetoric earlier. Speeches already play an important role  in the Iliad and Odyssey (eighth century BC) and 
Homer is clearly interested in different types of 
speaking. If we look beyond ancient Greece, we PLATO’S GORGIAS

dialogue Gorgias, Socrates 
and his interlocutors start out from the deceptively simple question ‘What is 
rhetoric?’ and soon find 
themselves discussing  power, politics, ethics, and the secret of a happy life.

"65ARCHIMEDES’ MASTERMINDOn a day in an era we now call the third 
century BC, a naked man was seen  
running through the agora of the Sicilian 
port of Syracuse. When people asked 
him: ‘Archimedes, what’s going on?’ he cried: ‘Eureka!’ (‘I found it!’) That approximately is the 
story as it was written down for the first time  
two hundred years later by the Roman architect Vitruvius and another century later by the Greek 
writer Plutarch, but whether it actually happened 
that way is another matter entirely. Reports tend to move further away from the facts with the  
passing of time and those who write them after 
such a long time often try to present their heroes in a favourable light — this will have been no  
different in Archimedes’ case. 
There is some certainty about Archimedes’ year 
of death, because he was killed by a Roman soldier when his native city Syracuse was taken during  
the Second Punic War, in 212  BC. And since the

"66ARCHIMEDES’ DEADLY WEAPON 
Although the siege of  
Syracuse resulted in his 
death, Archimedes is cred-ited with protecting the city from Roman attack with 
his innovative military tech-
niques and weapons. It is said he used polished shields to focus sunlight on 
enemy ships, creating a 
parabolic reflector to set 
fire to the vessels.

general Marcellus to spare his life. Marcellus 
greatly admired Archimedes and had wanted to 
use his knowledge; shocked by the brutal killing, 
he ordered a magnificent burial in the Syracusan necropolis. On the grave he had a monument erected consisting of a sphere enclosed in a  
cylinder of the same height and diameter. That 
was in accordance with Archimedes’ own wish, because he was proud to have proved that both 
the sphere’s surface and its volume equal two 
thirds of those of the cylinder, including its bases.
The Syracusans soon forgot Archimedes.  
When the Roman orator and statesman Cicero (106–43 BC) went looking for the grave of Antiq-
uity’s greatest mathematician on his visit to Sicily in 75, he found that none of the local dignitaries 
knew where it was. In the end Cicero managed to discover the grave, which was overgrown with shrubbery and indeed marked with a sphere inside 
a cylinder. But his discovery was lost again and 
nowadays — apart from claims by some hotel 
keeper looking for a profit — nobody knows the 
exact location of Archimedes’ final resting place.
The problem Archimedes was contemplating in 
his bath was one that King Hieron II of Syracuse (ruled c.270–215  BC) had posed to him. The king 
had given a quantity of pure gold to a goldsmith to make him an ingeniously plaited crown, but didn’t quite trust the smith. When the crown was finished, Hieron gave it to Archimedes with orders reports that he was seventy-five years old when he died, we may assume that he was born c.287 BC. 
The name he was given then, however, is uncer-
tain: Archimedes means something like ‘master-mind’ and may be an honorary nickname he was given by his admirers. In any case, that the Sicilian 
inventor in fact had a mastermind is beyond 
doubt. 
Archimedes was running naked over the  
market-place because he had been considering a difficult problem while taking a bath when he was struck by a brilliant idea. In his excitement he had 
jumped from his bath and run outside without 
thinking to dress. Incidentally, it was rare enough for him to take a bath: according to Plutarch, he was so obsessed with mathematics that he regularly 
forgot to eat and neglected his personal hygiene. 
When he started to smell, his friends would bathe him and rub him with oil, while Archimedes him-
self unflappably continued drawing figures in the 
sand on the floor with his finger.
That same obsession led to his untimely 
death — the fall of Syracuse had escaped his atten-
tion. As Archimedes sat contemplating some  figures drawn in the sand, a soldier arrived who prob ably had no idea whose house he had just 
entered. ‘Don’t disturb my circles!’ the mathe-matician allegedly said, and the soldier reacted  by running the old man through with his sword  —  despite explicit orders from the Roman

"67THE ANTIKYTHERA DEVICE 
Dubbed history’s first  
computer, this device 
found in 1901 in a ship-wreck near the Greek is-land Antikythera has both  
unlocked mysteries and 
created new perplexities. 
The clockwork mechanism 
was designed to predict astronomical positions and establish the cycle of the 
Olympic Games, on which 
the Greek calendar was based. The device’s date  is still being debated; the 
2nd half of the 2nd cent. 
BC is often suggested, while 205 BC is a recent 
hypothesis. It must have 
had predecessors in  Archimedes’ time.ARCHIMEDES’ MASTERMINDto find out whether the goldsmith had cheated 
him by mixing in some silver and pocketing the 
corresponding quantity of gold. When the mathe-
matician lowered himself into his next bath, two things occurred to him. Firstly that the water level rose because the volume of his body displaced an 
equal volume of water; secondly that he felt his 
own weight diminish. Archimedes suddenly real-ised that the decrease of his weight had to equal 
the weight of the displaced water. Since he also 
knew that a silver cube weighs less than a gold one the same size, he could now solve the prob-
lem. A crown with silver mixed in — no matter 
how complicated its shape —  and with the same 
weight as a crown of pure gold would have a big-
ger volume and weigh less under water as a conse-
quence, because of the bigger volume of water it 
displaced. ‘Eureka!’ Archimedes had a piece of pure gold weighing as much as the crown lowered 
into a bath-tub filled to the brim with water, so 
that it flowed over. Then he carefully took out  the gold, making the water level drop a little, and lowered the crown into the tub. As it ran over 
some more, Archimedes knew that the crown  
had a greater volume than the piece of gold. The goldsmith confessed and was severely punished, 
while Archimedes’ reputation had been established 
for good. The truth of the story is questioned nowadays; the importance of the discovery, how-ever, is not in the specific case of the crown, but in 
Archimedes’ formulating the general principle of 
the buoyant force which liquids exert on objects immersed in them.
Archimedes’ first and foremost interest was in 
pure mathematics and his work in this area is  that of a genius. He deduced the properties of 
parabolas, spirals, and polyhedra; he developed 
new ways to calculate roots, the length of an arch, the volume of a sphere, cylinder or cone, and to determine the value of the irrational number  . 
He also succeeded in calculating the area between a parabola and a straight line crossing it. The special importance of the latter problem lies in the fact that 
Archimedes regarded the parabola as the ideal form 
of a ship’s hull, so that it enabled him to work on the stability of floating ships.
T o impress his patron, Hieron, Archimedes 
looked for a bigger model of the universe than Aristotle’s geocentric system, which was generally accepted at the time and characterised by heavenly spheres revolving concentrically around a motion-less Earth. He chose the heliocentric system put forward by the Samian astronomer Aristarchus  
(fl. 280 BC); Copernicus was to rediscover it 
eighteen centuries later. T o calculate the size of this universe, Archimedes took the analogy of 
microcosm and macrocosm as his starting point: 
since he thought he had an idea of the radius of Earth and that of its orbit, he could calculate the 
radius and volume of the universe. Then he used 
his calculations to build a planetarium. He must have been very fond of it, because as far as we know it is the only device about which he himself 
wrote. That text has not come down to us, but 
Cicero describes the planetary as a complicated bronze mechanism with spheres representing the 
Sun, the Moon and the five planets that were 
known then. The spheres could be moved by means of cogwheels; the whole was enclosed in  a sphere studded with stars. The construction of 
such a device was long thought to be beyond the 
technical knowledge available in Antiquity, but in 1901 a metal mechanism was recovered from a 
first-century BC shipwreck near the Greek island Antikythera that is complicated enough to drive such a planetarium.
If there actually was an event at which  
Archimedes proved his ability as an engineer  with devices such as pulleys and levers, it must have been the launching of the Syracusia — report-
edly the biggest ship of Antiquity and built by 
Archimedes for King Hieron. As described it was 110 metres long and weighed over 2,000  tonnes; 
on board were a library, a gym and a swimming pool, a temple dedicated to Aphrodite, fishing ponds, stables and cattle sheds, a granary, several battle towers with a catapult, and lodging for  
soldiers and 600  passengers. Once it was finished, 
the monster ship had to be launched. T o the king’s 
astonishment, his inventor had constructed a  
system of pulleys and levers that enabled him to 
launch the ship single-handedly. Having seen that, Hiero ordered the Syracusans to ‘henceforth believe anything Archimedes said.’ "

APOLLO TEMPLE AT SYRACUSE 
Schematic drawing of  
the 6th-century Apollo 
temple at Syracuse. Siceli-ot temples of this period look stouter than their east-
Greek counterparts and 
have a huge entablature (architrave, frieze and cor -
nice) exerting immense 
forces on the lower half of 
the structure.The dynamic of the Greek expansion that 
occurred from the eighth century BC 
onwards, and the network of trade con-
tacts that went hand in hand with it, nat-
urally brought the Greeks prosperity. They traded with the locals, who provided them with grain 
while the Greeks delivered pottery and metals in 
return and introduced vine and olive cultivation on Sicily. The Greeks came into contact with 
many civilisations that were highly developed in 
technology and the arts. In the seventh century BC, Greek communities absorbed so many ele-
ments from the East that it is now known as the 
Orientalising period. One of the most important influences came from Egypt: monumental temple architecture. Within a few decades after the crea-
tion of a trade post in the Nile Delta (Naucratis, 
c.630 BC) the Greeks had familiarised themselves 
with the principal knowledge of how to dress 
large blocks of stone and use them in construc-
tion. They incorporated the technology into a characteristic style of architecture, which was exclusively applied in a religious context: the  
naoi (temples) for the gods. Operating from a 
strong sense of community, the Greeks had no need for monumental palaces or public buildings. 
Practically from its very beginnings, the new 
temple architecture was embraced with enthusi-asm by the Greek communities on Sicily.  The temples that were erected in cities such as 
Syracuse, Acragas (present-day Agrigento) and 
Selinus (Selinunte) during the sixth century BC distinguish themselves from their counterparts in 
the motherland by their daring design, their 
experimental constructions, and their impressive size. Between 600  and 400 BC dozens of sanctu-
aries sprang up in or near the island’s Greek cities 
(poleis). The Siceliot poleis, prospering through 
trade, agriculture and war, invested a fixed part — a 
tenth — of their revenue in their temples. This ena-
bled the class of priests to start an unprecedented 
construction boom. The vast majority of the new sanctuaries were erected on sites that could be 
seen from afar; a good example is Acragas, where 
no less than seven temples were built on a high ridge. In this way the buildings served as beacons for ships and travellers while overawing the  
inhabitants of nearby communities.     Temples and

TEMPLE OF VICTORY 
The Battle of Himera, 
fought in 480 BC, was one 
of the most important  battles of the Greek-Punic wars. It saw the Greek 
forces of Gelon, king of 
Syracuse, and Theron,  tyrant of Agrigentum,  defeat the Carthaginian  
force of Hamilcar, resul  -
ting in the crippling of 
Carthage’s power in Sicily 
for many decades. The  
big Doric temple at Himera was built in celebration of this Greek victory. Although many poleis had been established 
from Ionic-speaking regions along the Aegean 
coast and preserved a clearly Ionian identity, the 
temples were usually of the Doric order. The  Ionian citizens of Himera, for instance, had a big Doric temple (22.45  by 55 .95 m) built in 480 BC. 
This preference for the Doric order may be explained by the strong influence from the Dorian motherland — especially Corinth — during most  
of the Archaic period. Generally speaking, the sixth-century temples on Sicily are relatively stout. The Apollo temple of Syracuse (second quarter of 
the sixth century BC) is characterised by a robust 
architrave crowned by a Doric frieze with alter-nating metopes and triglyphs. T ogether with the cornice, these elements form a massive entablature 
that is quite a bit higher than the columns them-
selves. The result is a top-heavy structure entirely different from the temples of Athens, for instance. 
In most cases, the cornice was not decorated with sculpture. The cornice frames betray the influence 
of the metropolis (mother city), Corinth, in their 
heavy horizontal geison disappearing behind the 
raking geison. The monolithic columns are equally typical of the early Doric order at Corinth; from the second half of the sixth century onwards, the 
columns were constructed from loose drums.

Greece, but at each other’s temples as well. The 
temple of Himera, for instance, is practically iden-
tical to Athena’s temple in Syracuse; both were built at the tyrant Gelon’s instigation (see below). Competition between poleis led to the construc-
tion of ever bigger temples. The race culminated 
in two monster temples at Acragas and nearby Selinus. Of the so-called T emple G at Selinus,  
dedicated to Apollo, only a huge heap of stones "

‘Temple G’ at Selinus, one 
of the biggest Greek tem-
ples ever and dedicated to 
the city’s prestige as much 
as to Apollo, was never fin-ished. The stones that are 
left weigh up to 50 tonnes 
each. The rival city of Acra-gas built a temple to Zeus that was just a few metres 
bigger.
ZEUS TEMPLE, ACRAGAS 
Drawing of the Zeus Tem-

The tiny human figure on the steps says it all: this was the biggest temple in 
the Greek world — thanks 
to the prosperity that Sicily brought its Greek colonists. LOCATION AND MEANING  
OF SICELIOT SANCTUARIES
Greek sanctuaries had a distinctly local character 
that was sometimes determined by natural factors 
(e.g. Poseidon and the sea), but more often by 
purely practical motives. Visibility was paramount. For this reason the seven monumental temples  of Acragas were all laid out on the southern ridge 
of the plateau on which the city lies, with a view 
of (and from) the sea and the busy coastal route leading from Syracuse to Selinus. The structuring 
of the sacral landscape in Selinus is even clearer. 
The city itself lies on two hills between the rivers now called Modione and Belice. Nowadays the 
coastline is farther from the old city, but in Antiq-
uity the city lay directly by the sea. Some of its temples were located on the acropolis, some on two hills to either side of the city beyond the  
rivers. On the first hill were four monumental 
temples and a few smaller sanctuaries. No doubt the patron deity of the city was honoured here, 
perhaps Athena or Poseidon. Athena often was the 
protectress of citadels; Poseidon is plausible because of Selinus’ strongly maritime character. These cults would have been city-oriented, 
although the temples’ location on the citadel pro-
truding into the sea made them into excellent beacons for ships as well. On the eastern hill, over 
the Belice, were three more monumental sanctu-
aries — the gigantic T emple G among them. It is 
hardly a coincidence that these prestige objects faced the rivalling city Acragas. Moreover, Selinus 
was the last Greek colony on the Sicilian south 
coast if viewed from east to west; the area to the west was Carthaginian territory. The temples to 
the Olympian gods on the eastern hill thus form a 
logical connection with the rest of the Greek world. Sanctuaries to chthonic (earth) gods are remains today. Construction of this enormous temple (50 by 110  m) ceased before it was com-
pleted. The weight of the individual stones — up  
to fifty tonnes — gives an idea of the proportions. 
Shortly after Selinus had started building  
T emple G, Acragas commenced an identical pro-ject. The two neighbouring cities were competing 
for southern Sicily’s fertile arable land. The lucra-
tive trade between the eastern and western Medi-terranean provided a further incentive: both rivals 
were trying to become the principal entrepôt on 
the island. This competition explains why Acragas not only wanted more monumental temples than 
Selinus (seven versus five), but also wanted to have 
the biggest. With its 52 by 110  metres, the temple 
to Olympian Zeus is marginally larger than T em-ple G; based on its surface area, it can be called the 
biggest temple ever built in the Greek world. The 
most striking aspect of the design is the addition of connecting walls between the columns, meant 
to absorb the immense forces exerted by the 
entablature. 
SICILY AND THE SEA  TRADE AND COLONISATION"
"71TEMPLES AND COMMUNITY IN GREEK SICILY
THE GREEK TEMPLE OF EGESTA 
The native Elymians of 
Egesta (now Segesta) were 
Hellenised to such a de-gree that in the 5th century they hired an Athenian ar -
chitect to build them a Greek temple. It was never completed, though: the tabs used to lift the blocks 
into place have not been 
removed, the columns have not been finished 
with flutes, and the temple 
never had a cella or a roof. This provides important in-sights into the stages of 
temple construction.influence to Himera in the north and Syracuse in 
the east. Especially their incorporation of Himera, 
which bordered on Phoenician territory, greatly 
upset the Carthaginians. In 480 BC their general Hamilcar crossed to Sicily with a big army con-sisting of soldiers from Iberia, Sardinia, Corsica, 
Italy, Gaul, and Africa. Selinus joined the invading 
forces. The Greek coalition led by Gelon mustered an impressive army to counter the invasion and 
defeated Hamilcar decisively at Himera in that 
same year. The Phoenicians were forced to pay astronomical damages; the money was used to 
finance temple projects throughout the island,  
the aforementioned temples in Himera and the Athenaeum of Syracuse among them. As the latter occupied a central location (on the island Ortygia) 
in a city rising fast to great power, it was to be- 
come one of the most important sanctuaries on the island. Its wealth is clear from the tiles made  
of imported marble and a bronze shield on the 
roof which served as a beacon for ships. 
The fifth century also was a period of accultur-
ation of the native population of Sicily. Despite 
the permanent conflict between Egesta (present-
day Segesta) and its neighbour city Selinus, the native Elymian population was strongly influenced 
by Hellenic culture and design. In the 420s they 
had a temple built following classical Greek design and even hired an Athenian architect to supervise construction. Although the temple was never  
finished, it clearly complied with the classical 
Siceliot ideal of six by fourteen columns. 
Sicily’s temple-building age ended after a  
turbulent period of new conflicts at the end of  the fifth century BC. In 415 –413 a large Athenian 
invasion force could still be stopped, but a few 
years later the Carthaginians were successful. 
Between 409 and 405  they destroyed Himera,  
Selinus (which had sided with the Greeks again), Acragas and Gela, among others. That was the  
end of temple construction in these cities and 
although for instance Acragas was to see a revival in the Roman period, many sanctuaries — that to 
Olympian Zeus among them — were never com-
pleted. It was not until the fourth century that the Siceliot Greeks recovered from these blows, led by Syracuse, which became the undisputed capital of 
Greek Sicily. The age of the monumental temples, 
however, was gone forever.found at the west side of the city, where the great necropolis lay. The native god Malaphoros proba-
bly was identified with Demeter. The citizens of 
Selinus used their cults to define their territory and at the same time to appeal to the surrounding ethnic groups by using a religious symbolism these 
groups could easily understand.
T emples fulfilled a natural need to express reli-
gious feelings in a monumental way. They were the ultimate votive gift to the gods. The specific 
form certain cults took was a message to neigh-bouring communities, stressing common religious elements. It is generally accepted that monumental 
temple construction was used to create a connec-
tion with the rest of the Greek world. This would explain why the most outspoken efforts were 
made precisely in colonised regions outside the 
Greek mainland: in Asia Minor and on Sicily. 
CARTHAGE AND THE LAST GREAT TEMPLES
Because of the rampant growth of the Greek  cities on the south coast — Selinus, Acragas, and 
Gela — relations between them and the Phoeni-
cian community centred around Panormus (mod-ern Palermo) became troubled. The Greeks’ rising power and accumulated wealth is illustrated by a 
surge in temple building around 500 BC. This 
period also saw the rise of an aristocratic faction from Gela and Acragas. Led by Gelon (tyrant of 
Gela c.491 –478/7, of Syracuse 485 –478/7 BC)  
and Theron (tyrant of Acragas c.489–473  BC), this 
faction in 483  BC succeeded in extending its "

The Shipwreck 
     Gela INICOLÒ BRUNO
When the wreck Gela I was discovered 
in 1988, very few Archaic Greek wrecks were known. So when a 
 
fisherman pulled up four small 
ceramic altars decorated with vegetal motifs and a big fragment of Attic Black-Figure ceramic 
 
near Gela and showed them to a young maritime archaeologist from nearby Ragusa, the latter was so astonished that he convinced the fisherman 
 
to bring his finds to Gela’s Archaeological Museum that same day. And so began the adventure of one of the most important under -
water discoveries in the Mediterranean. After a series of investigations the local Soprintendenza localised the shipwreck c.800 m off the coast of Contrada Bulala, not far from the mouth of the 
river Gela, at a depth of 5 m, and started 
researching the site. The first excavation phase, from 1989 to 1994, was conducted with the method current at the time, using a movable 
 
grid that consisted of squares measuring 1.5 by 1.5 m; later the method of Cartesian coordinates measured from a fixed axis was applied. This phase ended with the discovery of the entire kel
-
son, seventeen ribs, and part of the ship’s side. The second excavation phase, from 2003 to 2008, aimed at the recovery and restoration of the wood, for which a complete documentation was indispensable. A grid of 8 by 13 squares measuring 1.5 by 1.5 m each was used, covering an area of 12 by 19.5 m, with four external fixing 
points for trilateration. During this phase the excavation of the areas not investigated earlier 
was completed, while the hull was completely recovered by disassembling the timber construc
-
tions. With the recovery of the remains of keel and stern the operation at sea was completed in July 2008, and the last load of ancient timber was sent to Mary Rose Archaeological Services in Portsmouth (UK) for restoration. The ship was covered by two layers, one consist
-
ing of sand and mud, the other of sand and  
fragments of shells, blanketing the entire wreck. The stratigraphy of the wreck itself comprised 
 
a first layer of stone ballast weighing c.7 tons, and a mat of vegetal fibres to protect the hull. The ship was built with the so-called shell-first technique: the ship’s sides formed the carrying structure, held together by ropes of plant material and mortise-and-tenon joints fixed with pins, while the ribs were fastened with nails; longer 
pins were used to connect sternpost and keel 
 
to the first planks of the hull. More detailed tech -
nical aspects of Archaic shipbuilding, unknown 
so far, will be documented after the restoration. The large amount of ballast makes it plausible that part of the cargo had already been unloaded at another port. In any case the recovered cargo, no matter how fragmentary, has made it possible to estimate its quantity and nature and to hypoth
-
esise about the ship’s probable route. As regards the cargo, the transport amphoras that have been found — mostly wine amphoras

from Chios, but also from Magna Graecia (south -
ern Italy and Sicily), Corinthian ones of the types 
A (containing oil) and B, Attic (oil), Phoenician, and a few originating from the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean — indicate that for this cargo 
a good deal of attention was paid to acquiring high-quality products. The rest of the pottery is 
 
of various types and origins as well: expensive Black- and Red-Figure Attic vases (including three rare Red-Figure askoi or spouted jugs attributed to Epictetus), Black-Gloss vases with varying pictures. The amount of Laconian and east-Greek pottery is limited, while local and colonial vases and imitations of Corinthian and 
Ionian pottery are numerous and of varied types. 
Research of the pottery has made it clear that 
 
the ship must have foundered at the beginning  
of the fifth century BC. Various other objects on board have been found, including the four small altars originating from the Peloponnese, a ceramic figurine of a seated deity, a little wooden arm originally belonging to 
 
a statuette, a ceramic flute, a silver fibula with a long catch plate, and fishing gear. It is thought that the bronze tripod included in the description of the finds that were handed in does not actually belong to the objects from the Gela I wreck. As to the ship’s route, analysis of the ballast rocks has led to the hypothesis that the ship 
came from Sicily’s east coast and was trying to 
reach its destination in a storm — Gela was an 
important trade centre with a busy port. In July 2014, all the recovered timber was returned to Gela in anticipation of a temporary exhibition at the city’s Archaeological Museum. After that, there will be a permanent display at the Museum of Greek Ships that has been planned on the southern slope of the ancient 
 
colony’s acropolis, not far from the river Gela. MERCHANT SHIP

THE METAL OF ATLANTIS 
Orichalcum ingots, 550–500 BC; l. 23 cm, 
weight 532 g (inv. no. 4241); l. 30 cm,  
weight 1155 g (inv. no. 4243). At the end of 2014, the cargo of an ancient shipwreck was discovered in the sea near Gela, 
the Rhodian-Cretan colony founded at the  
beginning of the seventh century BC, at a depth of c.5 m and a few hundred metres from the shore. It consisted of thirty-nine ingots of the 
rare metal orichalcum, an alloy of copper and 
zinc comparable to brass; it was considered a precious metal in Antiquity. This unique find is 
among the most important ones of the last 
years, because very few objects forged from  this alloy were known until now.  The Greek word oreichalkos (from oros, moun-
tain, and chalkos, copper already occurs in the 
seventh-century Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite:  in order to be presented to the gathering of the gods, the goddess is tended to by the Horae, 
daughters of Zeus, who dress her in divine  
garments and adorn her earlobes with ‘flowers  of orichalcum’. It is also used by the poet  Hesiod (c.700 BC) in Hercules’ Shield, where shin guards are described as ‘made of shining orichalcum, a marvellous gift from Hephaestus’.  
The fourth-century philosopher Plato in his dia-
logue Critias connects orichalcum to the mythi-
cal island of Atlantis, which the gods had given to Poseidon and which was named after his eld-est son, Atlas. The holy island was blessed with 
all that was necessary for living and besides of-
fered minerals, metals and orichalcum, ‘which is only a name now but was more than a name 
then, extracted from the earth in many places 
on the island and considered the most precious metal, apart from gold’. The citadel’s third wall was covered with ‘orichalcum with reflections of 
fire’; Poseidon’s temple had an ivory ceiling 
decorated with gold, silver and orichalcum, as were its walls, columns and floor. The decrees drawn up by Poseidon, finally, were incised on a 
column made of orichalcum which stood inside 
the god’s temple. In the following centuries, Latin authors also 
provide us with general information on this pre-
cious metal. During the Imperial Age the alloy was used to mint certain coins, e.g. sesterces.  The thirty-nine ingots have varying shapes, weights, and lengths: from 17 cm long and 254 g in weight to 32 cm and 1340 g. X-ray fluores-
cence analysis of the ingots shows that the alloy 
of which they are made consists of 75% copper and 15% zinc, with traces of lead and nickel. The presence of wooden fragments from the 
hull and some ribs indicates that the orichalcum 
was part of the cargo on a ship that foundered close to the shore, near three other wrecks that 
were already known. Apart from the ingots,  
several other objects have been recovered that were mostly intact and could shed light on the date of the shipwreck. The most important  
finds include an exaleiptron or kothon (ceramic 
box) imported from Corinth with geometric  decoration from the second half of the sixth century BC.

75THE SHIPWRECK OF CAPISTELLO (LIPARI)The Shipwreck of    
    Capistello (Lipari)ADRIANA FRESINA
The Aeolian Isles — kingdom of Aeolus, 
god of the winds — have a strategic  
location near the Strait of Messina and 
have thus been at the heart of Mediterra -
nean trade routes since prehistoric times, when the first travellers disembarking there discovered obsidian (see p. 17). The precious black glass made these islands and in particular Lipari one 
 
of the most prosperous centres in the Mediterra -
nean Basin. The finds that were made during archaeological excavations attest to the various cultures that flourished in the archipelago and are kept at the Archaeological Museum. Luigi Bernabò Brea and Madeleine Cavalier (see 
 
p. 19) are responsible for most of the arrange -
ments at the museum; it has an impressive  
section that is dedicated to maritime archaeology. The Capistello wreck constitutes one of the most important individual archaeological sites of the Aeolian Isles, both because of the number of finds it has yielded and because it has made possible the study of an ancient ship that has been preserved in part on the sea floor at a 
greater depth. 
The history of its discovery began in 1957, 
 
when some Club Méditerranée divers came up with fragments of various amphora types off 
 
Capistello. From then on the number of finds increased — but so did the looting. Many objects 
from the site were entrusted to the Aeolian Museum; in 1967, thanks to a customs seizure, it was able to add another 21 amphoras and over 200 Black-Gloss artefacts to its collection. 
 
The University of Messina’s Zoological Institute then conducted a series of measurings, locating the shipwreck at 300 m off the Lipari coast. The measurements were made at a depth of 55–60 m, while a medium-sized anchor stock was located at a depth of 80 m. The shipwreck on the Bank of Capistello appeared to be the most 
important ship find until then, but the depth was 
an obstacle to the necessary research. In 1969 scientific investigation was started, having been entrusted to the German Archaeological Institute at Rome and led by its vice-director 
 
Helmut Schläger and his assistant Udo Graf;  
the mission was suspended after a tragic diving accident. Years later, in 1976, research was resumed by the American Institute of Nautical Archaeology, 
 
in cooperation with Subsea Oil Service. The investigation was conducted with adequate equipment in view of the depth at which the shipwreck lay and new and safer research meth
-
ods were tried. The wreck turned out to occupy an area of c.20 m lying 300 m off the coast and 200 m from the Capistello Bank, on a sharply declining surface that sloped down to a depth of more than 100 m. The ship’s axis in fact was perpendicular to the slope; the hull was stopped from sliding down further by a huge projecting 
rock called ‘Matteucci’s Rock’, where the ship lay 
with the keel turned up and part of the cargo intact. PALERMOCAPISTELLO"

Most of these artefacts share the same charac -
teristics as to clay and glaze. Twelve types have been distinguished. There are many deep cups in several varieties, some without handles and with rosettes stamped onto the inside of the 
 
bottom. Other types include semispherical kylikes (singular kylix, a shallow type of cup) with painted decoration in the so-called Gnathia style, fish-plates and stemmed two-spouted oil lamps. From the analysis of the ceramics, archaeologists have inferred that the ship was transporting arte

-
ing the Aeolian Isles has many surprises in  
store for us yet.From the part of the wooden structure that was found, some very interesting information could be gleaned. The ship was built with the so-called shell-first technique, connecting the eight to ten 
plates of the ship’s side with each other using 
mortise-and-tenon joints fastened with pins, while the ship’s side was fixed to the ribs with copper nails. The ship must have been c.20 m long.Part of the cargo consisted of Graeco-Italic amphoras, many of which have been found intact and many in pieces. During the excavation of 1977, some hundred amphoras were recov

ered, all similar in shape and size. Many of them bear stamps on the handles; they were lined with bitumen, which was often used for wine ampho
-
ras. Some of them are still stoppered with corks, likewise covered in a thick layer of bitumen. 
 
The amphoras have been dated to the early  
third century BC by comparison to the amphoras found at Gela, which was destroyed in 282 BC.Another part of the cargo comprised Black-

The Shipwreck 
    Panarea IIIROBERTO LA ROCCA
The wreck Panarea III, which was already 
identified in 2010 following a campaign  
of side scan sonar measurements in cooperation with the Aurora Trust 
 
Foundation, was thoroughly explored in 2014  
by the Soprintendenza del Mare della Regione Siciliana, cooperating with Global Underwater Explorers. The wreck is located on a sandy sea floor at a depth of c.130 m, not far from the island of Panarea, north of Sicily. The sea floor has yielded a large number of amphoras deposited over an area with a drawn-
out oval shape corresponding precisely to the 
contours of the ship. Its characteristics cannot 
 
be inferred from the wooden hull at present, because it lies hidden under the hundreds of amphoras that constituted its cargo. The cargo has been analysed systematically, 
 
both from observations by a bathyscaphe  
(a deep-sea research submarine) and by  
deep-sea divers, with interesting results.The majority of the amphoras turned out to be of the late Graeco-Italic type. The small amphoras were probably used to transport expensive food
-
stuffs, such as high-quality wine. A large part of the amphoras were Phoenician ones of Sicilian 
 
or northern-African origin, stacked at the end of the cargo hold in what we think was the front of the ship. This part of the ship also contained the base of a grain mill and some cylindrical contain
-
ers of the ‘top hat’ type, some of them in stacks. These vessels, mostly known from the Iberian Peninsula, are thought to have been used for solid foodstuffs such as honey; they may also have been used as measures. In the same part of the ship some so-called fish-plates were found, as well as other plates of various sizes that were probably used by the crew. The most interesting object found at this end of the wreck is a thymiaterion or censer. It consists 
of a round ornamental base supporting a small 
cylindrical column with an even surface, on which a large, shallow bowl rests, its rim deco
-
rated with a relief of stylised waves. The censer could be nailed to the ship’s deck through four holes in the base. The Greek three-letter inscrip
-
tion carved into the base (STE) probably referred to the shipowners’ family that owned the ship; they must have lived in Campania. The censer stood close to the ship’s bow and was used for sacrificing on board. Historical sources tell us that this was done before departure or after 
 
difficult crossings and dangers one had escaped. The burns on the surface of the bowl suggest that fire was used at such sacrifices.Near the ship’s bow is a big rock on which a 
 
lead anchor stock lay, thrown from the ship in its hour of need. The position of the cargo makes it plausible that the ship foundered in such a way that it came to rest on its left side. This can be inferred from the position of the amphoras and from the presence of objects belonging to the ship’s equipment 
(plates, the grain-mill base, the censer) that

should have been in the hold or on the bow,  
tilted and thrown outside the area where the 
cargo was scattered.Based on the archaeological data that have 
 
been gathered, we can assume that the ship was on its way from southern Italy to Sicily. The type of cargo in particular indicates that the unfortu

nate ship had sailed from a port in Campania. That would mean that the Phoenician amphoras from Sicily or northern Africa were reused, com
-
ing from previous cargoes. So it is possible that the ship belonged to a merchant from Campania who sold foodstuffs in Sicily. The typology of the artefacts indicates that the ship sank around the end of the third century BC. In that period, Sicily and the Aeolian Islands were the scene of bloody battles during the 
 
Second Punic War (218–202 BC); one of the most important events was the conquest of 
 Syracuse in 212 BC by the Roman general Claudius Marcellus, during which the famous inventor Archimedes was killed. This allows for the possibility — as a last hypothesis — that the 
ship was part of a convoy sent to support the Roman navy operations against the Carthaginians by an allied city (Neapolis, Capua or Velia, for 
instance). In that case the ship could have been 
sunk during a naval battle. On the other hand, 
 
it is equally probable that it crashed into the steep cliffs of the islet of Dattilo, either by a 
 
navigation error or by an unforeseen change in the circumstances at sea.RECOVERED CERAMICS

"CHAPTER 4 
 CARTHAGE AND ROME"
"83
The war lasted without a break for 
twenty-four years and is the long-
est, most unintermittent, and great-
est war we know of. Apart from all 
the other battles and armaments, the total forces engaged were on one occasion almost 
500 ‘fives’ [quinqueremes], and on another 
nearly 700. Moreover the Romans lost 700 ‘fives’ in this war (including those lost  
to shipwreck), and the Carthaginians about 
500. So that those who marvel at the sea battles and power of the Hellenistic kings 
should be much more astonished by the 
scale of these forces. If we consider the dif-ferences in scale between ‘fives’ and ‘threes’ [triremes], with which the Persians fought 
against the Greeks and the Athenians against 
the Spartans, we shall find no forces of such magnitude ever met at sea before this war. 
(Polybius)
So the Greek historian Polybius, writing a  
hundred years later, concludes his account of the 
First Punic War (264—241 BC) between Rome and 
Carthage — a war known in Antiquity as ‘the Sicil-
ian War’. The conflict began when Rome came to the aid of Italic mercenaries who had seized the 
city of Zancle/Messana (present-day Messina) and were being besieged by both Carthaginian and Syracusan forces. The new ruler of Syracuse, King 
Hieron II (ruled c.270—215 BC), soon sided with 
Rome, and Rome moved to besiege the great southern Sicilian city of Acragas (modern Agrigento). When Acragas fell to Rome at the 
start of 261  BC, and with Syracuse now  
in alliance, the Romans resolved to try to seize  
control of all Sicily.
Western Sicily had been under Carthaginian 
control since the end of the fifth century BC,  and earlier treaties between Rome and Carthage (going back to the foundation of the Roman 
Republic in 509 BC) had confirmed that control 
while granting Romans the right to trade in  western Sicily. Carthage also controlled Sardinia; 
the more recent renewals of the treaties had 
increasingly limited Roman access to the western Mediterranean. Intermittent conflict between Carthage and Syracuse in the preceding two cen-
turies had swung back and forth: the tyrant Dio-
nysius I of Syracuse (ruled 406–367  BC) sacked 
the Phoenician settlement of Motya in 397  BC 
and Agathocles (ruler of Syracuse 316 –289 BC)  
led an ultimately unsuccessful invasion of north Africa in 310 –308 BC; Carthaginian forces in their 
turn reached the walls of Syracuse in 309  BC. But 
in the first half of the third century, the island was again roughly divided in half between them. Both sides had made extensive use of Italic (especially 
Campanian) mercenaries during these conflicts, 
increasing the cultural interaction and mixing of populations across the island. The Carthaginians continued to use Italian mercenaries to the end  
of the First Punic War, and the Montefortino

SICILY AND THE SEA  CARTHAGE AND ROMEthe Aegadian Islands and elsewhere in Sicily could 
in principle belong to soldiers from either side.
By the 260 s BC, Rome had conquered the 
entire Italian peninsula, and Sicily was one obvi-ous direction for further expansion. Crucially,  Sicily (together with Sardinia) offers the ability  
to control access across the western Mediterra-
nean — and western Sicily, now dominated by the 
Carthaginian foundation of Lilybaeum (Marsala), 
was integral to that control. In the debates  
preceding the instigation of the Third Punic War (149–146 BC), in which Rome finally destroyed 
Carthage, the Roman statesman Cato the Elder notoriously dropped ripe figs on the floor of the Roman Senate, fresh from Carthage — to illustrate 
the proximity of the danger, but also perhaps the 
prize to be won. The direct route across the  
T yrrhenian Basin, passing western Sicily, was  frequently used in Antiquity, but cabotage (hopping 
from port to port) was even more common, and 
both Sicily and Sardinia were integral to such trade. Deep-water wrecks identified on the Skerki Bank, north-west of Sicily, illustrate the former; 
the wrecks illustrated in this book the latter.
However, in trying to identify the motives for 
the Roman-Carthaginian struggle for Sicily, there is a difficulty. The evidence provided by wrecks, 
and above all by amphoras of this period such as the Punic and Graeco-Italic types on display, strongly suggests that the major increase in  
maritime trade across the region, and in particular 
between northern Africa, Sicily, and Campania,  followed the conclusion of the First Punic War 
rather than preceded it. One may argue that 
Rome went to war with this end in view, but it  is no less possible that this increase was simply  
the consequence of new opportunities being 
seized. The Roman state itself specifically pursued Sicilian grain as a commodity through taxa-tion — following the model of Hieron II of  
Syracuse, who used the grain of eastern Sicily  in what has been described as ‘grain diplomacy’ across the Mediterranean (e.g. sending grain to 
Rhodes after an earthquake in 227 BC as men-
tioned by Polybius; Rhodian imports to Sicily  are extensive throughout this period).
In any event, the struggle for control of Sicily, 
especially of western Sicily, required that Rome win control of the maritime channels and in par-MONTEFORTINO HELMET  
Bronze, mid-3rd cent. BC; h. 21 cm,  
rim diameter 19 cm 
This is one of the six Montefortino hel-mets—plus a simpler model, probably Phoenician—recovered from the sea near 
Levanzo, one of the Aegadian Islands off 
Sicily’s west point. Together with the rostra (ships’ battering-rams) found in the same stretch of sea, they constitute the archaeo-
logical evidence for the site of the Battle  
of the Aegadian Islands, which in 241 BC decided the First Punic War. The Montefor -
tino helmet type was named after the site of a necropolis in the Marche (a region in central Italy), where several specimens have been found. Its origins are the subject 
of debate; according to some scholars the 
earliest ones were made in Etrusco-Italic smithies, while others suppose that the helmet had Celtic origins and was intro-
duced by the Gauls living in Italy. In any 
case the Montefortino helmet is a product of cross-cultural influence and imitation, 
occurring from c.400 BC to the first centu-
ry BC. It was soon adopted by the Roman army and underwent modifications over time. 
Simple in form and effective in protection, 
the helmet was provided with an apex  that was sometimes hollow and onto which a crest could be fastened to make the  
soldier wearing it look taller. The helmet  on display, on the other hand, has a conic 
apex with a flattened top that is decorated with a little circle from which thin lines  radiate in relief. Round the knob are two 
rows of incised vertical lines with a subtle 
border of tiny vertical lines running at the bottom. The lengthened hemispherical cap bends outward at the back, forming a hori-
zontal projection to protect the back of the 
neck. The helmet’s lower rim is decorated with a cord motif and a subtle cornice of 
tiny egglets, above which three grooved 
bands mark the curve of the neck plate. Two of the bands are smooth, while the middle one is incised with zones of oblique 
lines. At the front of the helmet three  
parallel horizontal lines run above the grooves, forming a subtle chevron motif that corresponds to the neck plate.  
The rivets at the temples served to fasten 
movable cheek protection with hinges, kept in place by straps passing through  
a ring fixed to the rivet at the centre of  
the neck piece. The cheek plates of this helmet have been lost, but a pair belonging to another helmet was recovered from the 
sea near Levanzo.  
This helmet belongs to type D in Coarelli’s classification, dating from the middle of  the third century BC.

ticular the major harbours on the island, including 
Zancle, Panormus (modern Palermo), Acragas,  
and above all Lilybaeum. This opened a new phase 
in Roman military history. Rome had possessed naval forces on a small scale in the past, and the speakers’ platform in the Roman forum was called 
the rostra precisely because affixed to it were the 
bronze rostra (singular rostrum, a ship’s battering-ram) seized from the ships of Italic Antium in  
338 BC. But Roman fleets before 260  BC had 
been a few dozen ships at most. In anticipation of 
the first major battle, at Mylae (now Milazzo) in 
260 BC, Rome built its first major fleet of 100  
‘fives’, quinqueremes, modelled on Carthaginian 
ships. The type was supposedly invented by the Syracusan tyrant Dionysius I in the early fourth 
century BC. It is the unparalleled scale of this 
action to which Polybius draws attention in the passage quoted at the beginning of this article.
The bronze rostra on display testify directly to 
that activity and are almost unique. They show  the Roman internal organisation necessary to the financing and construction of such a fleet, as well 
as the customary Roman self-glorification by the 
statesmen involved. The two sides had fought themselves to a standstill by the time of the THE ARMY THAT FOUGHT AT SEA 
In the 3rd cent. BC, Rome 
had no experience in naval 
warfare. The Republic’s  military strength was on land, and its greatest  
advantages were the disci-
pline and courage of its soldiers. The naval Battle of Mylae (now Milazzo)  
was a stunning victory for 
Rome, mainly due to the use of the corvus (‘crow’) 
boarding device, a board-
ing-bridge that allowed Rome to use its soldiers against the superior 
Carthaginian naval skills. 
The Army that Fought at Sea by Severino Baraldi  (b. 1930), gouache on  
paper. Roman naval defeat at Drepanum (now Trapani) 
in 249 BC, and it was only a final effort, involving 
the financing of ships for the Roman fleet by  
private individuals, that enabled Rome to put the ships to sea that were victorious in the Battle of the Aegadian Islands off western Sicily in March 
241 BC. The rostra also cause difficulties for  
historians: in particular, they are far smaller than 
we would expect for quinqueremes, providing 
unique evidence for ship size and design, and  
call into question whether Polybius may be guilty of exaggeration. Furthermore, the fact that seven 
of the rostra so far recovered from the site of that  
battle bear Latin inscriptions, and only one a Punic text, when Rome was victorious, needs explaining: perhaps some of the Roman rams 
were from captured ships, re-used by the equally 
desperate Carthaginians. One notable point is the technical similarity between the Punic ram and 
the Latin ones — all by itself, this speaks not simply 
of technological exchange, but of the movement 
of craftsmen as well as culture across the region.
At the end of the First Punic War, Rome may 
well have established a magistrate in control in 
Lilybaeum. From 227 BC onwards, the Romans 
stationed praetors (senior magistrates with legal and "
"86
military authority, second only to the consuls) in 
both Sicily and Sardinia. In Sicily the praetor ini -
tially resided at Lilybaeum, but during the Second Punic War Syracuse revolted and joined the 
Carthaginian side in a bid for greater independence 
from Rome. The revolt was crushed and Syracuse was sacked in 211  BC by the Roman general Mar
-
cellus; after that, Rome controlled the entire island from Syracuse. However, Sicily was unusual as a 
province in having two quaestors (subordinates to 
the praetor, with primarily financial responsibili
-
ties), one of whom was always based in Lilybaeum, doubtless reflecting the continued maritime signifi
-
cance of the western end of the island.
The First Punic War seems to have had a fairly 
devastating impact on much of western Sicily in 
particular, and some cities, such as Camarina, 
never fully recovered. The impact of the second war fell principally on south-eastern Sicily.  However, Italic settlers multiplied on the island, 
and large parts of Sicily seem to have been very 
prosperous in the second century. Naval action was much more limited in both the Second  
(218–202 BC) and Third (149 –146) Punic Wars, 
perhaps because Sicily and Sardinia were no 
longer the direct focus; perhaps because neither 
state could sustain the scale of another such 
encounter — although, disconcertingly, the  
great harbour of Carthage seems to have been constructed after the First Punic War. In all three  
wars Sicily served as the staging post for Roman 
invasions — in which no doubt many Sicilian  
ships were involved — of north Africa: the abortive 
expedition of Regulus in 256 /255 BC; the inva-
sion of Scipio Africanus 204 –202 BC, which  
culminated in the defeat of Hannibal at the Battle of Zama in 202; and the final siege of Carthage by 
Scipio Aemilianus in 147–146 BC. Sicilian grain 
served Roman armies throughout these and other 
Roman campaigns; but Sicilian sailors also served, 
whether in the wars in the eastern Mediterranean 
of the second century or in the Third Punic War itself. In 146  BC, Sicilian works of art seized as 
booty by Carthage in past centuries were restored 
to Sicilian cities by a grateful Scipio after the  
sack of Carthage — perhaps to be seen as partial 
compensation for the Sicilian wealth seized by 
Rome in the preceding wars, and bringing the 
story full circle for the Sicilians.NAVAL BATTERING-RAM

by a frontal collision with another ram.  
The carved inscription, in Punic letters, may be read as an adjuration to the god Ba’al: ‘May this [ram] be directed against

"87    Carthage and 
  the Spoils of the    
    Sicilian WarsROALD DOCTER
During much of the fifth and fourth  
centuries BC, the Carthaginians were 
engaged in a series of battles with the 
Greek city-states over the control of  
Sicily. The vicissitudes of these wars, commonly known as the Sicilian or Greek-Punic Wars, can 
be followed through the accounts of Classical 
Greek authors (chiefly Diodorus Siculus, first  century BC); Punic historical accounts are con-
spicuously absent. Although our sources thus pro-
vide us with only one side of the story, we may grasp some details that are of interest for the pre-
sent subject, the booty taken by the Carthaginians 
after their victories that were either sold on the spot or taken to Carthage in triumph. In this  small contribution, the well-known historical 
information is supplemented with some archaeo-
logical data that may be interpreted as part of the Carthaginian booty from the Sicilian Wars. More 
in particular, it is argued that they belong to the 
spoils of the so-called Second Sicilian War, con-ventionally dated between 410  and 340  BCE.
THE CARGO OF THE PORTICELLO SHIPWRECK
The Porticello shipwreck was found in the Strait of Messina near the mainland village of Porticello 
in 1969 and then partly looted by a gang of illicit 
divers and fishermen. The remaining portion was 
excavated under scientifically controlled conditions in the following year by a team of T exas University 
led by D. Owen. Its publication by C. Jones Eise-
man and B.S. Ridgway (1987) showed that a small merchantman of approximately 16 –20 m and 30  
tons had been wrecked on the treacherous shores 
of the Strait in the decades around 400 BC. It had 
carried a mixed cargo of some 130  transport am - 
phoras, both Punic (Carthaginian and Maltese), perhaps for olive oil and fish sauce, and Greek ones 
for wine (Byzantine, i.e. from Byzantion and the 
Hellespont, northern-Greek from the city of Mende, and west-Greek), together with Greek 
utilitarian pottery (ink wells), Attic lead ingots 
from the Laurium mines, and fragments of Greek life-size bronze statues. Since then, more objects have turned up that can in all likelihood be attrib-
uted to the same context, and that stem from the 
initial clandestine looting of the site. Among these is another head of a male figure, once in Basel 
(Switzerland) but now returned to the Museum in 
Reggio, Italy.
In 1991–1992, M. Paoletti published a thought-
provoking article on the cargo of the shipwreck, temptingly and convincingly arguing that the bronze sculptural fragments were transported as scrap metal and originally were part of the spoils  
of the Sicilian Wars, in particular from the period between 409 and 406 BC. In 409, the Carthaginians 
took both Selinus (present-day Selinunte) and 
Himera and sacked their temples; in 406 the same 
befell Acragas (Agrigento). Diodorus vividly 
describes the fate of the latter town and its treasures:
But [the Carthaginian general] Himilcar, after pillaging and industriously ransacking CARTHAGE AND THE SPOILS OF THE SICILIAN WARS"

the temples and dwellings, collected as great 
a store of booty as a city could be expected to 
yield which had been inhabited by two hun-
dred thousand people, had gone unravaged since the date of its founding, had been well-
nigh the wealthiest of the Greek cities of that 
day, and whose citizens, furthermore, had shown their love of the beautiful in expensive 
collections of works of art of every descrip-
tion. Indeed a multitude of paintings executed with the greatest care was found and an ex-
traordinary number of sculptures of every 
description and worked with great skill. The most valuable pieces, accordingly, Himilcar 
sent to Carthage, among which, as it turned 
out, was the bull of Phalaris [see p. 42], and the rest of the pillage he sold as booty.  
(transl. C. H. Oldfather)
Paoletti convincingly argues that the fragments 
of bronze sculptures in the Porticello wreck stem 
from such a sale of remaining booty.
Although there was much debate on the chro-
nology of the twenty or so fragments of bronze statues in the cargo, the identification of the de- picted figures, and in fact the number of original fragments, it now seems generally accepted that 
the fragments belong to two statues that once may 
even have formed a group. These are generally dated to the third quarter of the fifth century BC, 
or even as late as 420 BC.
The tempting suggestion that the bronze  
sculpture fragments originate from the Carthagin-ian sack of Greek towns on Sicily in 409-406 BC 
implicitly narrows down the date of the ship-wreck. This narrower date within the 415 –385 BC 
span that was initially proposed seems to find  corroboration in the lead ingots that have been attributed to the Laurium silver mines in Attica  
as a result of lead-isotope analysis. Silver and lead 
mining in the Laurium region seems to have come to a standstill after the Athenian defeat in 405 BC. It was only resumed in the 370 s BC. A 
date for the cargo before c.405  BC is therefore 
most likely.

huge early-Roman levelling layer which covered 
the remains of the Punic city and is mainly com-
posed of debris resulting from the destruction of Carthage in 146  BC. The excavator, Hans Georg 
Niemeyer, immediately recognised its importance 
and already in 1989 published the architectural ele-
ment in a short article. A concave funnel-shaped channel runs through the fragment from back to 
front in a downward direction. This allowed the 
identification of the fragment as the right corner block of a sima, the constructive part that marked 
the transition of the entablature to the gabled roof 
of a temple in Greek style. Water spouts, mostly in the shape of lion’s heads, drained the water from the roof to the sides at regular distances.
The fine-grained yellowish marble, the crafts-
manship and stylistic comparisons all hinted at a still unknown Greek workshop active in Magna 
Graecia, or more precisely on Sicily. The preserved 
height of the piece (0 .34 m), broken off in its 
upper part, clearly suggested its belonging to a monumental construction, probably a temple. 
Stressing its monumentality, Niemeyer compared 
the size to the lions’-head spouts of the Athenaion (Athena T emple) in Syracuse, which measure 0 .25 
m. On the basis of stylistic comparison with pieces from Sicily and Athens, he proposed a date within the first half of the fourth century BC. Lacking the larger part of the lion’s face, offering a preciser  
date would have stretched the evidence too much.
Niemeyer interpreted the sima fragment as  
having been part of a free-standing temple of 
Greek architectural order, constructed within the city of Carthage during the first half of the fourth 
century BC. This would not be completely 
improbable, since the Punic pantheon of Carthage 
is also characterised by a strong assimilation with Greek gods from the fourth century BC on,  especially with regard to the iconography. In 396  
BC, the cult of Demeter and Kore (Persephone) was introduced in Carthage from Sicily in com-pensation of the sacrileges committed by Cartha-
ginian troops in the Greek Demeter and Kore 
temple of Syracuse and the resulting plague that struck the troops in Sicily.
Three arguments may be brought up against 
this explanation of the sima block’s presence in Carthage. Firstly, no other example of a free-standing temple of Greek design is known in the 
Punic world at this time; the Punic-Roman tem-
ple of Antas Pater in south-west Sardinia at first sight would be the exception to the rule, but its 
present state is of Roman date. Secondly, if this 
element was part of a Greek-style temple erected in Carthage, the implication would be that the Carthaginians commissioned and shipped the 
architectural elements of a complete and monu-
mental temple from Sicily. Although not impossi-ble in itself (and there are some examples attested 
in Antiquity), it would be a rare exception. Thirdly 
and most importantly, the fragment itself offers an argument against this interpretation. Already Nie-meyer was puzzled by the absence of calcareous 
sinter traces on the surface of the water-draining 
part and tentatively suggested that a lead pipe, now lost, had covered the interior. If this were the 
case, one would have expected the lead to have WATER SPOUT

appropriate gift to a sanctuary upon his victorious 
return.
The second question is more difficult to 
answer. Seeing the typological date of the piece and assuming that it had never been used when it was taken by the Carthaginians, any victorious 
occasion would come into consideration. The  
historical evidence for this period however is not quite complete, so assigning the piece to one  
particular occasion would probably stretch the 
evidence too much. Among the possible occasions one might nevertheless mention e.g. the Carthag-
inian siege of Syracuse in 397 /396 broken off 
when a plague hit the troops, or General Himil-
co’s victories over Syracusan troops in 376  BC.
The historian Appian (second century AD), 
basing himself on the writings of Polybius who had witnessed the end of Carthage, gives us a good insight into what happened when Carthage 
itself was finally taken by the Romans in 146  BC:
Carthage being destroyed, Scipio gave the 
soldiers a certain number of days for plunder, 
reserving the gold, silver, and temple gifts. 
He also gave numerous prizes to all who had distinguished themselves for bravery, except 
those who had violated the shrine of Apollo. 
He sent a swift ship, embellished with spoils to Rome to announce the victory. He also sent word to Sicily that whatever temple 
gifts they could identify as taken from them 
by the Carthaginians in former wars they might come and take away. Thus he 
endeared himself to the people as one who 
united clemency with power. The rest of the spoils he sold, and, in sacrificial cincture, 
burned the arms, engines, and useless ships as 
an offering to Mars and Minerva, according to the Roman custom. (transl. H. White)
Diodorus Siculus explicitly states that the 
famous bull of Phalaris mentioned before was 
returned to the people of Acragas on that occa-
sion, and that it was still in the city at the time he 
wrote his World History in the first century BC. The lion’s-head spout, evidently of lesser intrinsic value, was never reclaimed by any Greek city on 
Sicily and remained buried in Carthaginian soil.left at least some traces on the marble surface, which is not the case. Rather, it seems that the 
block was never used for its primary function at all, neither in its place of production (Sicily) nor in Carthage.
The suggestion I would propose here is that 
the architectural element was originally meant for a Sicilian Greek temple or other large public 
building that was under construction when the 
Carthaginians took possession. It was then seized in the workshop and brought to Carthage where it was dedicated in a sanctuary, displayed in public or even in private. If this interpretation is correct, 
two questions remain: Why then a lion’s-head 
water spout, or in other words, why a lion? And on which historical occasion was the piece taken from Sicily to Carthage?
The first question is perhaps easiest to answer. 
Lion-headed gods and goddesses played an impor-
tant role in Carthaginian religious beliefs. First 
and foremost is the goddess Sekhmet of Egyptian Memphis, who was venerated as a goddess of war (amongst other roles), incorporating aspects of 
revenge, curing illnesses, and protecting the royal 
family. She had been assimilated with Astarte, both in the East and in Carthage; in the latter, Astarte 
was worshipped especially during the fourth and 
third centuries BC. It is therefore not unlikely  that the Sicilian lion’s-head spout had a particular appeal for a Carthaginian conqueror and made an SICILIAN LIONS

When the Roman Senate decided, after 
the victory over Carthage in 241  BC 
and the subsequent annexation of most of Sicily, not only to establish 
specific treaties of dependence with each of the numerous Sicilian city-states, but also to maintain 
the unified structure of the Carthaginian ‘eparchy’ 
(administrative district) by treating the entirety of the new territories as a new ‘operational district’ 
(provincia) consigned to a single magistrate, few 
were aware that this makeshift arrangement was to be the beginning of an administrative revolution. 
The new arrangement profoundly changed not 
only the conditions of living on the island, but also the very structure of the newly-founded Roman Empire. On the one hand, the genesis  
of the provincial system involved the creation of a 
new class of magistrates, the provincial governors, whose individual interests diverged gradually  
from those of the egalitarian Senate and ultimately 
provoked the conflict between magistrates and nobility. On the other hand, the wholesale  transformation of entire territories into Roman 
provinces paradoxically brought about their  
gradual convergence with the Roman social and political model and thus facilitated the slow  
transfer of political decision-making from the Sicily under Roman

Though the Romans had to wait until the  
Second Punic War (218 –201) and the annexation 
of the kingdom of Syracuse to the Sicilian  province in 212 /210 to be able to extend their 
dominion over the whole island, the decision to send a praetor — to assure peace, to arbitrate in  
legal conflicts involving Roman citizens and to 
supervise, with the help of two quaestores, the  
collection of tribute (tributum) and import tax (portorium) — was to influence the further evolu-
tion of the island profoundly. Firstly, the intense 
contacts with Rome, the presence of numerous 
Italic merchants and finally the foundation of Roman colonies gradually diminished the influ-ence of Greek culture and contributed to the 
Romanisation of Sicily. Secondly, the cessation of 
wars within Sicily and the gradual harmonisation of trade and exchange under Roman auspices made possible a great social and financial mobility 
and facilitated the emergence of considerable 
landholdings. Thirdly and most importantly, the ever tighter political control exerted over the 
island enabled the Romans to transform Sicily, 
through a complex system of fixed-prize acquisi-tions, tax clearings or simply requisitions, into 
Rome’s main grain supplier, as the Italic economy 
gradually became dominated by high-profit spe-cialist agriculture of wine and fruit and was no longer able to satisfy the capital’s grain demand.

The war was mainly triggered by slaves rebelling against their cruel owner, Damophilus of Enna  (a town in central Sicily), and was led by Eunus from Apamea, a charismatic leader claiming a  
special relationship to the goddess Dea Syria. After 
occupying Enna and liberating all slaves, Eunus was crowned king and joined his forces with 
another contingent of rebelling slaves led by 
Cleon from Cilicia and occupying Agrigentum.  It is interesting to notice to what extent this 
rebellion, unlike the revolt of Spartacus two  
generations later, assumed a political character and mirrored the main cultural and strategic antago-nisms of the contemporary Mediterranean world. 
Indeed, Eunus not only adopted the throne name 
‘Antiochus’ and put it on his coinage, but he also elevated his wife to the status of queen, set up a 
council of ‘friends’ in imitation of contemporary 
Hellenistic court practices and even called his new citizens ‘Syrians’; hinting thus not only at the importance of Syria as a major source of Sicilian 
slaves, but also referring to the Seleucid state — the 
only remaining Mediterranean superpower beside 
Rome — as the ultimate counter-model to the 
Roman Republic. After conquering major centres such as Tauromenium (present-day Taormina), Catana (now Catania) and Morgantina and men-acing perhaps even Syracuse, the slaves for several 
years resisted all attempts by Roman troops to  
dislodge them and provoked a major grain short-age in Rome in 138 , before the Romans were 
compelled to send, over three successive years, the consuls Gaius Fulvius Flaccus (134 ), Lucius Cal-
purnius Piso Frugi (133 ) and Publius Rupilius 
(132) in order to re-establish Roman power over 
the island. After the conquests of Morgantina and Enna, Eunus was forced to flee, was captured by the Romans, and shortly afterwards died from an 
illness before his transfer to Rome. 
The outbreak of the Second Servile War only 
two decades later (104 –101) shows that the mere 
defeat of Eunus had been far from resolving the 
structural causes of the Sicilian troubles, even more so as the resistance of local slave-owners managed to impede the Senate’s half-hearted 
attempts to verify the lawfulness of the status of  
a certain number of Sicilian slaves. This time, it local merchants as well as Italic and Roman inves-tors to make enormous profits, often with the 
tacit approval of corrupt provincial governors, 
whereas other merchants or even cities could be easily ruined if they dared to oppose the Roman provincial system. This was even more so as the 
governors generally changed every year and had 
less interest in establishing a durable relationship between centre and periphery than in replenish-
ing their own financial resources as quickly as 
possible while a legal action of provincials against a governor (actio de repetundis) was rarely successful, 
as it was judged by the governor’s fellow senators. 
At the same time, Rome’s victorious wars against Macedonia (200–197  and 171 –168), Syria (192 –
188), Carthage (149 –146) and Greece (147 –146) as 
well as its expeditions into Hispania had generated a sheer endless and relatively cheap supply of the Italic markets with enslaved prisoners-of-war, and 
eastern Mediterranean piracy, ravaging the Syrian 
coasts in order to provide the markets with further illegal slaves, guaranteed constant new arrivals. The devastation of Sicily as well as Italy through the 
military expeditions of the first two Punic Wars, 
the subsequent ruin of small landholdings and the disproportionate enrichment of military leaders 
and war profiteers made possible the creation of 
large agricultural estates (latifundia) cultivated by slaves and devoted to monocultures like, in the case of Sicily, grain and pasture. While profits 
soared, the result of this evolution was not only a 
gradual polarisation of society into rich and poor as well as into masters and slaves, but also a grow-
ing political antagonism between partisans of the 
Roman order and its enemies. Thus emerged, on the one hand, a class of wealthy landowners gen-
erally in favour of the Roman occupation, while 
on the other hand the discontentment of the ever-growing slave population often recruited from prisoners-of-war was not only directed 
against their social condition as such, but against 
the Roman state in general, held responsible for their enslavement and thus considered not only a 
social, but also a political antagonist.
It comes as no surprise that the growing unrest 
finally led, during the course of the second cen-
tury, to open rebellions which the Roman troops 
found extremely difficult to quell, given the mili-
tary background of many slaves. One of the most "

ing a mass exodus from the island, but again,  
the Romans suffered important losses before the 
victory of the consul of 101 , Marcus Aquillius.
It is doubtful whether the relative peace fol-
lowing the slave revolts was due to inner reforms 
or rather to a general exhaustion of the island and 
a tighter military control by the Romans. The lat-
ter point is, for instance, exemplified by the harsh measures the infamous governor Gaius Verres is 
said to have taken during his government of Sicily 
(73–71 ) in order to avoid a contagion of the is- 
land’s slave population by the simultaneous  
revolt of Spartacus on the Italian peninsula, the 
Third Servile War (73–71 ). Nevertheless, the sub-
sequent trial and condemnation of Verres for cor-ruption, illegal and unjust taxation and the extor-
tion of art works may be an indication for the 
growing interaction between provincial and Roman elite as well as for the victory — albeit 
slow and partial — of the ideal of a humaner pro-
vincial administration during the Late Roman Republic. At the same time, the gradual unifica-tion and provincialisation of the Mediterranean 
world under Roman rule, accompanied by the 
repelling of piracy, contributed to the depoliticis-ing of social unrest, as there seemed to be no real 
alternative to Roman rule. Social discontentment 
was henceforth to be expressed and negotiated within the Roman political system and not by rejecting it outright, a factor that may also be one 
of the reasons why Sicily was to provide such an 
important power basis for Sextus Pompey’s (son of the famous Pompey; see Van Maanen’s contribu-
tion) ephemeral political position. was the Cilician astronomer Athenion who first donned the diadem and occupied the island’s  
west, expropriating rich landowners in favour of community propriety. Meanwhile in the east,  Triocala (present-day Caltabellotta) became the 
palace city of another slave king called Salvius  
and adopting ‘Tryphon’ as regal name. He also represented his power by lictors (attendants  
carrying fasces, bundles of rods from which an axe 
projected, as symbols of the magistrate’s power) and wore a combination of the senatorial tunica laticlavia (tunic with a broad purple stripe) and the 
triumphal toga purpurea, illustrating the growing 
impact of Roman political symbolism. As with Eunus, Athenion’s and Tryphon’s defeat was pre-
programmed due to the impossibility of organis-SPARTACUS

"95SICILY UNDER ROMAN REPUBLICAN RULE: ROMAN PROVINCE AND SLAVE KINGDOMA BRONZE ELEPHANT’S LEG 
Bronze, 3rd cent. BC; total h. 63 cm,  
max. w. 48 cm, th. 0.8–1.4 cm. 
Fragment of a life-size bronze elephant’s leg in flexed position. The upper part is bent, the surface cut by deep horizontal  
incisions representing the folds in the  
animal’s leathery skin; on the left side,  the big veins under the skin have been rendered. The lower part, representing  
the foot (h. 16–18 cm), is wider and has 
little dents and incisions on the surface.  On the foot a patina is visible, produced  
by constant rubbing. Below the foot we see 
a smooth band, c.2.5 cm high, meant to  fit into the pedestal, which was probably made of stone. In the upper part of the 
fragment some inlays can be seen which 
hide the openings left by the sprues (letting 
gases escape or molten bronze flow in). 
Several elements (the patina on the foot caused by the touch of countless hands, the statue’s frontality) suggest that the bronze elephant must have stood in a  public place with a celebratory function.  
The technical and decorative characte-
ristics could point to Phoenician-Sicilian, northern-African or Iberian origins, but equally to a workshop in Rome. Elephants 
played an important part in warfare and 
were often depicted, especially in Phoeni-cian culture (most of all on coins minted around the end of the third century BC).  
The recovery was made in the Mediterra-
nean Sea between Sicily and Tunisia on 3 July 1999 from the trawler Capitan Ciccio 
originating from Mazara del Vallo, Captain 
Francesco Adragna.  Rossella Giglio 
HERCULES AND ANTAEUS GRAPPLING White coarse-grained marble, 2nd cent. BC;  
h. 80 cm, w. 45 cm. Hercules is depicted with big, sunken  eyes, mouth closed with a pronounced  upper lip, a wrinkle in his forehead, short 
haircut, a beard with small curls, a power -
ful neck and tensed abdominal muscles. 
His straight left leg supports all his body weight, while the right leg is bent in an  
effort to lift his adversary, whom he is  
gripping around the waist with both arms. His entire body is turning to the left, his 
back arched in the effort to heave the giant 
off the ground. Antaeus, his left arm bent at a right angle and the wrist flexed, is  trying to free himself from Hercules’ grip 
with his left hand while pushing against  
his opponent’s forearm with the right; his left leg is stretched in an attempt to touch ground, more or less crossing Hercules’ 
leg. The effort of the struggle is expressed 
by the bulging muscles of arms, legs, and abdomen. The back of the sculpture has 
hardly been dressed and constitutes a  
kind of square pilaster, suggesting that  the marble had to be propped against a background or, less probably, that it was 
unfinished. Antaeus’ head and right  
leg are missing; the lower part of the  composition is incomplete.  The sculpture depicts one of Hercules’ mythical labours, in which the hero is forced to fight the Libyan giant Antaeus, son of Poseidon and Gaia (Earth). He man-
ages to defeat Antaeus by lifting him off  
the ground, so that he can no longer draw on his mother’s strength. What we see here is the end of the battle: the giant, heaved 
up by Hercules, is about to succumb.Two 
figurative traditions of this battle have been identified between the fourth century BC 
and the height of the Hellenistic period. 
They are not very different: the giant is  always attacked from behind. But his legs can also be free or bent forward instead  
of intertwined with Hercules’ legs, and the 
giant is sometimes gripped by the torso  instead of between waist and groin. The traditions probably represent two different 
moments in the struggle. The sculpture 
was found in the course of public works  in Catania’s harbour area in 1927. The  
Sicilian archaeologist Libertini considered  
it to be a late Hellenistic copy from a fifth/fourth-century original. Some fragments were lost during the recovery.

INGOT OF CAPO PASSERO  
Cast lead, 100–50 BC; l. 48.5/45.7 cm,  
w. 9.8 cm; weight 34.3 kg. 
This semicylindrical lead ingot belonged to a cargo that was found near the shipwreck of Capo Passero (the south-east point of Sicily),  
a short distance from the coast. It is in excellent 
state. Twelve bars of lead were recovered. Metal analysis has made it possible to trace both the mines from which the lead originates and the 
names of the merchants involved in this huge 
trade. The conquest of Spain and its mines  following the Punic Wars and the establishment 
of the tribus (administrative districts) in combi-
nation with the politics of trust in a particular  social class, the liberti (freed slaves) from practi-cally every Spanish mine, caused an explosive 
growth in this market that reached its peak 
around the first century BC. The ‘humble lead’, 
in fact produced by the exploitation of and 
search for silver mines, was commonly used in Roman architecture (piping and conduits — un-
fortunately, the Romans had no idea that lead is poisonous), in daily life (kitchen utensils), in warfare (ships’ battering-rams, weaponry), and 
most of all in the alloys for coins. The specimens 
found at Capo Passero originate from the mines at the Sierra Morena and Cartagine-Mazzaron in southern Spain. Thanks to nuclear neutron to-
mography performed at the Helmholtz-Zentrum 
in Berlin we can read the inscriptions hidden under the accretions, providing further clues as to the merchants involved and the weight.  
The present ingot bears the following inscription:
[dolphin] M[arci] Oct[…] M[arci] l[iberti] 
Papil[…] [caduceus, messenger’s staff]
This points to a merchant whose name, Octavi-us, we also find in Croatia (Lastovo) and Sardinia.  
Many are the wrecks from the first century BC that were transporting ingots of lead through the 
Mediterranean and to Sicily. One of them is the 
shipwreck discovered at great depth in the Strait 
of Messina, another that of Mal di Ventre Island 
near Sardinia.   Philippe Tisseyre
COMMERCIAL LABEL Lead, 4th/3rd cent. BC; h. 12 cm, w. 20 cm,  
th. 0.5 cm. 
In the ancient world as now, goods were labelled before transport in order to provide the relevant information to the parties concerned. These la-
bels were thin metal plates, usually rectangular 
or square and made of lead, such as this one. They were manufactured by pouring molten lead into a mould to produce big sheets that were 
then cut into small squares that were sometimes 
perforated. Finds of such labels extend from Croatia to Austria and North Africa. The labels 
were used for foodstuffs and spices, but could 
also indicate activities and professions. In the case of money transport, the label stated the sum of money in the pouch to which it was  
attached.  
The information on the transport labels was scratched into the lead in initials, abbreviations and figures that were no doubt immediately 
comprehensible to the user. The inscription 
would mention a person’s name and sometimes the type of goods to which the label was  attached. It functioned like a modern delivery 
note and was probably removed upon delivery.  
This label was recovered at a depth of 12 metres off San Vito Lo Capo in north-western Sicily.  The folded lead was found precisely opposite 
the site of a garum (fish-sauce) factory  in what 
is now the Tonnara del Secco, south of the bay. The Greek inscription reads ΩINNIONI or, from right to left, INOINNIΩ, ‘belonging to Inoinnios’, 
a name of possibly Thracian origin deriving from 
the goddess Inna. Although we can’t be certain of Inoinnios’ role, we may assume that he want-
ed to specify the ownership of a batch of 
goods — possibly amphoras with garum from 
that very factory that would never reach their destination. Near the modern fish-processing  
installations to the north-north-east, at least fif-
teen tanks lined with crushed pottery have been found on the surface. The small size of the  tanks indicates that several types of fish were 
processed in this factory. From the Phoenician 
ceramics that have come to light (amphoras of the types Manà B3, Manà C1 and 2, Manà D, and torpedo-shaped amphoras) we can deduce 
that the fish factory at San Vito Lo Capo played 
an important role in fish production in the Phoe-nician world in the fourth/fifth century BC. On the sea floor opposite the factory site there are 
numerous remains of amphoras that probably 
belonged to ships foundered right off the coast.

SICILY AND THE SEA  CARTHAGE AND ROME"
"97Sicily as a RefugeWILLEM VAN MAANEN
At its narrowest point, the Strait of 
Messina is merely 3.15  km wide: under 
favourable circumstances one can swim from the mainland to Sicily. Nonetheless 
it took Octavian (the future Emperor Augustus,  27 BC–AD 14 ) and his armies six years and a  
half to gain a foothold on the island. All that time it was held by a very talented admiral, Sextus Pompey (c.67 –35 BC), who not only ruled Sicily 
but held Octavian’s Italy in an iron grip. 
It was a time of civil war. After the murder of 
Julius Caesar in 44  BC, a military dictatorship had 
been established on the Italian mainland, which was run by three generals from Caesar’s faction: Lepidus, Mark Antony, and Octavian. They wanted to eliminate Caesar’s killers, who had created a 
power-base in Greece around Brutus and Cassius. 
Preparations were being made for an expedition to Greece to stage a decisive battle. 
The triumvirate intended to leave Italy behind 
in a state of fear. T o achieve that, as soon as they came to power they started publishing lists of  elite citizens who could be killed with impunity: 
the infamous proscriptions. They mostly featured 
political enemies of the triumvirate, but affluent neutral citizens were targeted as well. Soon many 
had been executed, while others were running for 
their lives. 
Sicily became the first refuge for the outlaws. 
The island was controlled by a young navy com-
mander who had let it be known throughout Italy 
that all outlaws were welcome. The triumvirate might have placed a colossal sum on the outlaws’ 
heads, but he was doubling it for their rescue. 
The audacious admiral’s name had a magic  
ring to it. Sextus Pompey was the only remaining son of Pompey the Great, Caesar’s famed rival, 
who had died on an Egyptian beach five years earlier. Pompey the Great had conquered Asia Minor and swept the Mediterranean clean of pirates; his name still carried prestige and the 
appearance of his son gave people hope under  
the Caesarians’ dictatorship. 
Many outlaws went on the long and perilous 
journey to Italy’s southernmost point. Calabria 
was teeming with the triumvirate’s patrols, hunt-
ing down fugitives, but Sextus’ ships were cruising along the coast to pick them up before they fell 
into the patrols’ hands. 
Wild stories of escape were circulating.  
A man had carried his father on his back all the way along the Via Popilia through southern Italy, 
reaching the coast unharmed; another had  masqueraded as a priest of Isis, wearing a jackal mask; a third one had pretended to be a diplomat 
for Octavian, haughtily commandeering a ship  
for his crossing at Regium (present-day Reggio).
The success of Sextus’ haven thwarted the  
triumvirate’s plans. Brutus and Cassius had been defeated at Philippi in Thessaly, but Sextus had created a new hotbed of resistance on Sicily. It  was further strengthened by survivors from 
Philippi, who came to Sicily with a large fleet. 
As Sextus’ party grew in importance on Sicily, 
he increased pressure on the triumvirate by  blocking trade routes. Rome depended on grain 
that was transported by sea — the cheapest way of 
transport by far. The city had grown so big that  at least 800  shiploads of grain a year were needed 
to feed it. Ships carrying grain sailed into the  T yrrhenian Sea from all over the Mediterranean; the grain was transhipped in the Bay of Naples to 
be transported along the coast and up the Tiber 
on smaller ships. Now this route was hermetically closed by Sextus. 
Rome faced a terrible famine that lasted three 
years. The triumvirate’s prestige plummeted to  the point where they had stones thrown at them SICILY AS A REFUGE"

in the streets. Particularly Octavian, who had  
been rewarded with the province of Italy after 
Philippi, was on the receiving end and was under 
great pres sure to make a deal with Pompey. Mark 
Antony, who had been given the east of the empire while Lepidus was fobbed off with Africa, was 
scheming from a distance, buttering up Sextus  
and Octavian by turns. 
Meanwhile, ‘Hunger was fighting for Pompey,’ 
as one of his men happily described it. But pres-sure on the young admiral to make a deal was also 
growing. The outlaws, seeing their opportunity to 
return to their estates in Italy, wanted to make the most of the propitious developments. T o Sextus’ 
anger, some of them had started negotiations with 
Octavian behind his back regarding restitution  of their property. 
In 39 BC a treaty was made between the ruler 
of the sea and the rulers of the mainland: the Treaty of Misenum (modern Miseno in the Bay  of Naples). The outlaws were granted an amnesty and were satisfied with restitution of a quarter of 
their properties. Sextus stayed in control of the 
western islands, to which the Peloponnese was added: he now controlled practically the entire  
sea around Italy. The country was celebrating; 
Pompey invited his enemies to a magnificent  banquet on board his flagship; the outlaws returned to the mainland in triumph. Sextus’ strategy had always been defensive and 
based on resisting the triumvirate. It seems that  
he had no wish to conquer the mainland. With 
the amnesty, his party fell apart, but Sextus still had his most powerful weapon. The triumvirate had promised to restore the republic; Sextus kept an 
eye on their results from his ships. 
His opponent Octavian in Rome had other 
ambitions. Within a year after the treaty, he again risked his reputation and started another war to 
get rid of Sextus. Initially the only result again  
was famine and unrest in Rome.
Octavian’s fleet was defeated twice in a row.  
On the crossroads of Rome, people told scornful stories on how Octavian himself had jumped ship 
in the Strait of Messina to clamber up the rocky shore and hide in a cave. A derisive epigram  circulated, jeering that the triumvir had recently 
taken to gambling because then at least he could 
win now and then. 
In the history of the future Emperor Augustus 
there are quite a few poor military performances, 
and this was one of them. But it is also the history 
of Octavian’s extremely able and loyal supporters. Enter Marcus Agrippa, fresh from victory in Gaul, 
for which he declined to have a triumphal proces-
sion because it would be too painful for Octavian. 
Agrippa was to decide the war over Sicily for 
Octavian. He established a secret training base for SEXTUS POMPEIUS

In the next naval battle over Sicily, it was 
Agrippa’s well-trained troops who delivered the decisive blow. In 36  BC, Sextus was defeated off

Then came the punitive expeditions. A travelling

Vix e conspectu Siculae telluris in altum / vela 
dabant laeti… (Virgil, Aeneid 1, 34–5)
(Hardly out of sight of Sicilian land they, sea-bound, / merrily spread their sails)
The famous narrative of Virgil’s Aeneid starts at 
sea, ‘hardly out of sight of Sicilian land’, with the Trojan refugees merrily (laeti) ploughing the waters towards their fated destination, Italy’s prov-
ince of Latium, which they will only reach after 
various hardships on sea and land. Their optimistic mind-set when setting sail from Sicily may seem somewhat awkward, given the fact that their 
leader Aeneas has only just lost and buried his 
father Anchises on the western tip of Sicily, near modern-day Trapani. This state of mind will soon change, for Aeneas’ nemesis, the goddess Juno, 
plots against him.  
A furious tempest will hit the Trojans and initiate the famous story of the Carthaginian queen 
Dido’s wronged love for Aeneas. Episodes that  
are set on and around Sicily chronologically frame the Trojans’ sojourn in Carthage. In the third book 
of the Aeneid, Aeneas himself tells Dido about  
his circumnavigation of the island, from Mount Etna in a southward sweep along the coast to Drepanum (present-day Trapani); in the fifth book 
the Trojans revisit the island, having left Dido in  
a desperate state.
This contribution will focus on the selective 
use Virgil made of tradition when he wrote  Sicily-related scenes into his epic, and on the image of Sicily he thereby created. Echoes and adaptations of well-established mythology were 
included in the poem, as well as allusions to 
Roman historical feats. It will be argued that  Virgil’s first readers would understand the result-

"101THE FRAGMENTARY VOICES OF THE SEA
Aenean adventure would not ‘just’ be a Roman-
ised version of the adventures of Homer’s Odys-
seus. Given the important role Sicily had played  
in Roman history, and especially during the Punic Wars, the island’s geography almost naturally alluded to events in historical times. Even a covert 
salute to a Sicilian victory won by Virgil’s patron, 
the Emperor Augustus, may be present in Aeneid 5.
HOMER REVIEWED 
Tradition before Virgil had had its say about the island. Greek scholars, for example, had in the  
preceding centuries decided on the topography  
of Odysseus’ mythological voyage. Scylla and  Charybdis lurked in what is now the Strait of Messina, and the Cyclopes had supposedly  
inhabited the coastal fringe near Mount Etna.  
Virgil, in the epic rendering of the sea voyage  of his hero, could hardly ignore this — and he did 
not indeed. When Aeneas first reaches the east coast of Sicily (3.554 ff.), references to the Odys-
sean stories appear. Significantly, though, Virgil 
deflates the fanciful and gory aspects Homer’s 
Odysseus had stressed when he told of his past predicaments at the Phaeacians’ court. No Trojan shipmates are crushed between Cyclopes’ jaws  or by the limbs of Scylla. Rather, Virgil elaborates on a natural monstrum, with a wonderful fifteen-
line description of Mount Etna’s volcanism. The 
anxiety the nightly roaring of the mountain causes the Trojans (3.583 ff.) may, by the way, have stirred 
Augustus’ memory when he first heard this scene recited. According to the historian Appian (second century AD), the future emperor had spent a  night at the foot of the thundering volcano him-
self during his campaign against Sextus Pompey 
(see p. 97 ) in 36  BC.
The dangerous currents of Charybdis’ maelstrom 
are present in the Aeneid, it is true, but they are quite easily overcome with some diligent rowing. Here, it is interesting to note that Virgil describes the roaring of the surf in personified manner  
(fractas ad litora voces, 3.556 : ‘voices, broken on the 
shoreline’). It is tempting to read this phrase as a 
statement from the poet, subtly indicating that his 
narrative incorporates fragmented versions of 
older stories. Indeed, Scylla in the Aeneid remains 
only a name (or were the ‘broken voices’ hers?)

BC, in which the consul Publius Claudius Pulcher 
reportedly lost some ninety ships. It may even  
be possible to trace an echo from history in the 
earlier rescuing story of Achaemenides, for it was near the ‘Cyclopes’ Coast’ that the Roman nation, as if in Aeneas’ footsteps, in 265  BC first landed 
two legions on Sicily in a bid to aid the city of Zancle/Messana (now Messina) against the Carthaginians — the incident that started the  
First Punic War. After this war the island fell  to the Romans and the cities introduced by Achaemenides became allies of Rome.
ROMANISING SICILY
The western tip of Sicily, the site of Anchises’  burial, connects Aeneid books 3 and 5. Even 
though the Trojans return to its direct surround-
ings, ‘unhappy’ Drepanum is not mentioned in book 5. The region appears friendly, even home-like; for it turns out that the local chief Acestes  
has a semi-Trojan pedigree.
This focus on a ‘Trojan’ and therefore, given  
the design of the Aeneid, ‘proto-Roman’ part of Sicily was rooted in a long tradition. Centuries 
earlier, the Athenian historian Thucydides (c.455 –
400 BC) had written of Trojans who had sailed to 
Sicily to found the city of Segesta. Archaeology 
proves the special bond this city had with Aeneas, for he features on several coins minted at Se-  ges ta — some dating from the period of the Punic 
Wars, some from the Augustan Age in which Virgil 
wrote. In the Aeneid, the wearier of Aeneas’ com-rades are left behind in newly founded Segesta 
under the rule of Acestes. Thus an important claim 
is made via constructed mythology: that Sicily was ‘Roman’ before the Phoenicians ever came there. This claim overrules historical fact, for this same 
western part of the island had been a long-stand-
ing Carthaginian stronghold. The nearby sanctuary of Venus on Mount Eryx (now Monte Erice; the 
sanctuary had previously been dedicated to Punic 
Astarte) had been hotly contested during the First Punic War; Virgil discards Astarte and has Aeneas found the temple in honour of his divine mother.
A final case of appropriation may be present  
in Virgil’s description of the funeral games Aeneas organises to honour his other, mortal parent, 
Anchises. This sequence, which is clearly modelled 
on the games Achilles held for his beloved  they escaped from Polyphemus’ cave. Masterfully, 
Virgil includes this salute to his epic predecessor 
in his poem. What seems to be a playful addition to the well-known adventures of Odysseus func-tions as a conciliatory gesture in the greater scheme 
of the Aeneid, for Aeneas saves his former Greek 
enemy from his plight. Polyphemus and his clan  
of giants (and with them, the sphere of fanciful 
mythology) are left behind. They soar statically like 
‘oaks and cypress trees on a high crest’ (3 .679-80)  
as the Trojans start their tour of the island.
In a strikingly anachronistic sequence, Achae-
menides next identifies various settlements along the shore that in reality would only be founded  by Greek colonists in historical times. In a fasci-
nating study, Nora Goldschmidt suggests these  
cities would, with the reader of Virgil’s day, kindle memories of national history. For example, ‘lofty 
Agrigentum with its massive walls’ would recall 
the long and arduous siege of this city during  the First Punic War. It should be noted that the Annals of Quintus Ennius (239 –169 BC) and 
Gaius Naevius’ (fl. c.220 BC) Punic War were 
widely read epics of the pre-Virgilian era. Both these poems, of which only fragments survive, had 
treated episodes from the days of the Punic Wars 
set on Sicily (and Aeneas had featured in both of them, too). Against this background, Goldschmidt argues, when Virgil uses the epithet inlaetabilis 
(‘unlucky’) to characterise the harbour of Drepa-
num, this is not only to sketch Aeneas’ reaction to the death of his father. A cultured Roman would 
also think of the catastrophic naval battle of 249

"103THE FRAGMENTARY VOICES OF THE SEAearlier, in 260  BC, Gaius Duilius had surprised  
the Carthaginians off Mylae (present-day Milazzo) 
with his newly constructed fleet. This battle is 
remembered for being the first Roman victory over Carthage in a naval showdown. Duilius was awarded a rostral column (i.e. decorated with the 
battering-rams of enemy ships) that still stood in 
the Roman Forum in Virgil’s days. From an extant fragment of Ennius’ epic, it is clear that  
he included a scene set on a warship in his Annals. 
Virgil, in his turn including Trojans showing their ability as sailors in this specific area, makes the 
point: Sicily is where Rome began to rule the 
waves.
Interestingly, according to Appian, Augustus 
himself had boasted his own ‘Duilian’ victory 
against Sextus Pompey, won in the same waters  
off Mylae in 36  BC, with the erection of his own 
‘Duilian Column’; coins depicting this monument 
survive. Against this background, the suggestion 
seems defendable that some passages of Virgil’s poem could also be read (albeit covertly) as a me- morial to the emperor’s exploits on and around 
Sicily. Augustus had heard Mount Etna roar, and 
he had won his victory at sea. Or, to be more  precise, he had witnessed his admiral Agrippa win 
the day, remaining ashore himself — just as Aeneas 
did, witnessing the boat race.
FRACTAS AD LITORA VOCES
‘Merrily, they sailed Sicilian waters.’ At first glance, 
the image of wondrous, peaceful, and affluent  
Sicily Virgil created was heavily dependent on 
tales from Homer. For those who had knowledge of the many struggles fought on the island, how-ever, the text was full of possible resonances. Sicily, 
it was to be understood, had always been con-
nected to Rome. The visit of the proto-Roman hero teemed with allusions to the days of Rome’s 
rise to world power.Patroclus in Iliad 23 , features one novel, non-
Homeric element. Aeneas has several ship-crews compete in an exciting boat race. The names of 
the ships’ captains were meaningful to the Roman audience, for Virgil ‘translates’ Trojan names into 
those of important Roman families. This allows 
him an allusion to near-contemporary history.  The ship of Sergestus hits the rocks: its captain, who is an ‘ancestor’ of the infamous politician 
Lucius Sergius Catilina, ‘in the fury of his mind’ 
(furens animi: 5, 202) had steered into perilous waters.
Y et the real double entendre of this passage comes 
to the fore when we realise that it was off the Sicilian coast that the Roman Republic had first 
shown its naval prowess, after centuries of battles 
fought on land. It was at a site opposite — even  
in full view of — Aeneas’ supposed boat race, near 
the Aegadian Islands, that the First Punic War was 
decided (and Sicily won) with the triumph over 
the Carthaginian admiral Hanno in 241  BC. And SICILIAN GAMES

    Sicily in The  
Rape of Proserpine 
    by ClaudianPIET GERBRANDY
Sicily has always been regarded as an ex- 
ceptional place in the Mediterranean.  
As an island, and quite a large one at that, 
it flaunts its insular identity and relative 
isolation, while its dimensions seem to make it a self-contained continent surrounded by the sea. 
Sicily is something between island and mainland, 
surveyable enough to be seen as a unity, but suffi-ciently spacious to allow many different facets, 
both ecologically and culturally. Situated between 
Greece, Italy, and northern Africa, it did not be-long to any of these cultural domains, while at the 
same time sharing elements of all. In Classical 
Antiquity, any visitor from Rome, Athens, Alexan-dria, or Carthage would recognise some aspects but still feel a stranger. Its most remarkable asset, 
however, is its agricultural fertility, caused by the 
unpredictable volcano dominating the eastern skyline of the island. Here, peril and prosperity  
are indissolubly entwined. 
Not surprisingly, Sicily, due to its otherness in 
the eyes of continental travellers, came to host 
numerous mythological stories, one of them be- 
ing the grim tale of Proserpine’s abduction by her 
uncle Dis (Greek: Hades), king of the dead. The myth survives in many versions. In Late Antiquity, 
when Christian emperors enthusiastically sup-
pressed pagan cults, Claudius Claudianus (c. AD 370–405?) wrote his thrilling three-book epic  
The Rape of Proserpine. Most of Claudian’s Proser-
pine story is located in the vicinity of Mount 
Etna, just like Ovid’s (43 BC–AD 18 ) versions in the Metamorphoses and Fasti. How to read this poem? And what part is played by its Sicilian mise 
en scène?
Claudian was an Egyptian whose native  
language is assumed to have been Greek. While 
some of his poetry is actually in Greek, the bulk 
of it is written in flawless, even brilliant Latin. 
Although he was a foreigner, he succeeded in obtaining the position of poet laureate at the 
court of Honorius (AD 384 –423), the young 
emperor of the West, and his tutor and chief  
commander Stilicho (d. 408), himself of Germanic 
descent. From January 395  until 404 , Claudian, 
presumably living in Rome or Milan, dedicated 
most of his inspiration to this general’s military and political achievements. Imagine this outsider, 
composing thundering panegyrics in a foreign 
language, probably admired and at the same time despised by the ruling elite of Roman senators 
and ecclesiastics. When at Stilicho’s bidding a 
statue in the poet’s honour was erected on Trajan’s Forum in Rome, Claudian’s pride may have been mixed with feelings of apprehension. He must 
have realised he would never cease to be an alien. 
The Rape of Proserpine is not an occasional poem, 
which makes it a special case in the corpus of Claudian’s works. Moreover, it is unfinished. Three 
books of uneven length are transmitted in the manuscripts, which suggests the poet did not find the time, or the energy, to complete it. Enough 
remains, however, to reconstruct the epic in its 
final state, since its contents are announced in the 
SICILY AND THE SEA  CARTHAGE AND ROME"
"105SICILY IN THE RAPE OF PROSERPINE BY CLAUDIAN
opening pages of Book I. Few scholars doubt that 
the poem should have numbered four books, so 
what is missing is only the dénouement, culminat-
ing in, first, the divine agreement in which Proser-pine (Greek: Persephone) will spend part of the year in Hell, the other part in Heaven or on Earth; 
second, the establishment of the mystery cult in 
Eleusis, near Athens; and third, the invention of agriculture, initiated by Proserpine’s mother, the 
fertility goddess Ceres (Greek: Demeter). Among 
academic interpreters, there is no consensus as to the meaning of the epic. Whether we should see it 
as a virtuoso’s stunt in intertextuality or as a pro-
found exploration of existential, sexual, religious, political, or ecological themes, its musical qualities and imagery are dazzling. In order to protect her innocent daughter from 
delusive suitors, Ceres decides to house Proserpine 
in a hidden palace in the neighbourhood of 
Mount Etna, near mysteriously deep Lake Pergusa. Subsequently, Ceres departs to Asia Minor, where 
her mother Cybele lives. In the meantime, the 
girl’s father, Jupiter (Zeus), grants his brother Dis permission to kidnap her and take her for his bride. T o make this happen, Venus (Aphrodite) is 
to persuade Proserpine to leave the safe premises 
of the palace (Book I). When both goddesses, accompanied by their half-sisters Minerva (Pallas 
Athene) and Diana (Artemis), are picking flowers 
in the sunny vales of Etna, Dis amidst a pande-monium of earthquakes emerges from the deep  
to grab the astonished virgin (Book II). In Book REMBRANDT’S PROSERPINE 
The comparative textual 
study with which  
Rembrandt would have been familiar from the  Latin school, through Ovid, 
Virgil, Horace, and others, 
is most evident in his painting The abduction  of Proserpine, which re-
flects Claudian’s De raptu  
Proserpinae. Ovid’s version of Proserpina’s story was 
already rich in details of 
landscape and expression, but Claudian’s was more elaborate in these re-
spects. Only Claudian  
described Minerva, Venus 
and Diana as Proserpina’s 
companions; they are also present in Rembrandt’s painting. Rembrandt van

secret chill, and the flame harmlessly licks 
the nearby frost with smoke that is loyal to 
its pledge. (translation Claire Gruzelier)
In Book II, Etna is described as a ‘mother of 
flowers’ (parens florum), who addresses Zephyrus,  
a southern breeze gently blowing in spring, to 
create a paradisiacal atmosphere appropriate to  the impending ‘love affair’. Immediately, he  
‘tinged the roses with a blood-red brilliance and 
the billberries with black, and splashed the violets with deep purple sweetness. What Parthian belts, 
fit to tie around the breasts of kings, are variegated 
with so many jewels?’ This is the charming side of Sicily. 
On the other hand, when Ceres sets out to 
search her daughter, she first enters a forest, also on the slopes of the volcano, where not long ago Jupiter conquered the Giants, sons of Mother 
Earth who had endeavoured to overthrow his 
recently established government. The trees of the wood uncannily testify to the Olympians’ victory, as the decaying corpses of the defeated still droop 
from the branches: ‘Here hang the gaping jaws, 
here the monstrous hides of the giants, faces nailed to tree-trunks still threaten cruelly, the enormous 
bones of serpents whiten everywhere in bloodless 
heaps, and the stiff skins smoke from many  thunderbolts’. This is the island’s gloomy aspect. 
Inevitably, classicists tend to speculate if the 
poet ever visited Sicily. We’ll never know, of course, since all details concerning the island’s environmental particularities could be found in 
Claudian’s literary sources, extending from the 
Greek poet Pindar (c.520–440 BC) and the Augustan poets Virgil and Ovid to geographical 
treatises composed in both Greek and Latin. But 
that may be beside the point. T o Claudian, Sicily belonged to the world of myth and fantasy. What he depicts is a symbolic landscape, perfectly suited 
to the weird story he wished to tell. And per-
haps — but this is speculation once more — the 
permanent stranger he was could only feel at 
home in a remote abode created by imagination. III Ceres embarks on the quest for her daughter, of whose whereabouts she is completely ignorant. 
There the poem breaks off. 
Claudian effectively exploits the geographical, 
geological, and meteorological aspects of the stage the story is set on. Where better to situate the epiphany of the king of Hell than at the foot of a volcano that simultaneously fosters snow and fire? 
This is where opposites meet, where Underworld 
and Heaven, life and death, heat and chill, and possibly also male and female are strung together 
in a paradoxical juxtaposition. This is part of  
Claudian’s description of Etna (I. 163 –170):
nunc uomit indigenas nimbos piceaque  
 grauatum
foedat nube diem, nunc molibus astra lacessitterrificis damnisque suis incendia nutrit.
sed quamuis nimio feruens exuberet aestu,
scit niuibus seruare fidem pariterque fauillis:durescit glacies tanti secura uaporis,
arcano defensa gelu, fumoque fideli
lambit contiguas innoxia flamma pruinas.
Now it vomits forth the clouds that are born 
within it and defiles the daylight, that is 
oppressed with pitchy gloom; now it assails the stars with terrifying masses of rock and 
feeds fires by expending itself. But although 
it seethes over, boiling with excessive heat, it knows how to keep faith with the snows and equally with the hot ashes: the ice hardens, 
untroubled by all the steam, protected by its SICILY

‘As for the fertility of the place, why 
need I speak of it, since it is talked 
about by everyone and declared to  
be in no way inferior to Italy’s; in fact 
in grain, honey, saffron, and certain other things  it could even be claimed to be superior. There is  
also the fact of its proximity, for the island is, as  
it were, a part of Italy, and supplies Rome easily and effortlessly with each thing in turn as if it 
came from the fields of Italy. Indeed it is called  
the storehouse of Rome (…). ’ (Strabo (c.60  BC–
AD 20), Geography), transl. H. L. JonesSicily’s central position at the crossroads of the 
Mediterranean and its proximity to Rome were 
key to its economic prosperity as a Roman prov-
ince. After the devastation of the First Punic War (264–241 BC) and the assimilation of most of the 
island into the Roman sphere of influence after 241 BC (and all of it after 211  BC), it took time 
for Sicilian communities to recover; but all the 
signs are that they soon adjusted to a novel situa-
tion, the need to pay a grain tax to an outside master. Agriculture seems to have moved into a 
higher gear to create the necessary surplus, and 
the added incentive of being able to sell at market prices any grain produced in excess of the tax threshold may have been a spur to be even more 
productive: it seems likely that more land was 
brought into cultivation than ever before. The outcome was not a province ground down by excessive taxation but a flourishing one in which 
the excess profits were turned into impressive 
rebuilding programmes that took place in many town centres during the course of the second century BC — paid for by local landed elites who 
chose to display their munificence in this way. Inscriptions were still placed, in Greek, by ‘the council and the people’, as they had always been. 
Even municipal fleets in some coastal towns sur-
vived into the first century BC: a sign of continu-ing, albeit nominal independence and of civic pride.

it made no sense to continue to live on waterless 
hill-tops, entailing a long trudge to and from the 
fields each day — especially when a good propor-
tion of the harvest was destined not for urban  
granaries but for the ports, to be shipped to Rome and elsewhere. Over time many of the hill towns 
were abandoned in favour of smaller settlements 
situated close to or on the main roads and in the well-watered plains, but these agricultural villages 
had few of the amenities and none of the splen-
dour of the old hill-top poleis (city-states). The shift in the settlement pattern is striking: some 
fifty towns are known to have been occupied 
c.200 BC, but four centuries later, by the end of 
the second century AD, barely fifteen major towns 
were still flourishing urban communities. A few 
were inland, but most were located on the sea, where they were able to maximise their economic opportunities through the constant flow of goods 
in and out of their harbours.  
The pax was rudely shattered when Sicily once 
more became a theatre of war in the second half 
of the first century BC. Sextus Pompey, son of 
Pompey the Great, seized Sicily in 43 BC and 
treated it as his personal fiefdom for seven years. The Sicilian corn supply to Rome was cut;  money and men for army and fleet were diverted 
to Sextus Pompey’s cause. By 38  BC Octavian  
(the future Emperor Augustus) could brook  
Sicilian isolationism no longer. Not all went his way in his early encounters with Sextus Pompey’s  
fleet, however, and in one bitter encounter off Tauromenium (present-day Taormina), Octavian was lucky to escape with his life. The north-east 
coastal strip bore the brunt of the fighting, and in 
the final battle of 36  BC, in the bay of Naulochus 
east of Mylae (modern Milazzo), Octavian won  
a crushing naval victory, followed by the capitula-
tion of Sextus Pompey’s land forces. An isolated warship wrecked off what is now Capo Raso-
colmo, with coins of the right date and a metal 
strip stamped with Sextus Pompey’s name, might have been limping away from the site of the  Naulochus battle (which lies some 30  km further 
west), or was sunk in some other encounter  during these years. 
Sicily was now back in the fold. Octavian 
erected a temple to Diana on the shore of

was no doubt another familiar feature of the Sicil-
ian coastline, but whether it stood at a suspected 
Neptune sanctuary near the lighthouse on Cape 
Pelorus or at the entrance to Messana’s harbour is uncertain.
The major harbour towns upgraded their civic 
buildings during the Roman Empire; the theatres, odea (concert halls), amphitheatre and baths of  Catana (now Catania) and Tauromenium are 
among the more impressive surviving reminders 
of the Roman era on the island. We know little in detail about port facilities, however, not least 
because erosion, silting up, sea-level changes and 
natural disasters have often obliterated ancient harbour works. Catana’s harbour disappeared  altogether beneath the lava flow of 1669 ; part of 
Lilybaeum’s (present-day Marsala’s) harbour and the coastal ‘emporium’ of Agrigentum have silted up and are unrecognisable; Palermo’s (ancient 
Panormus’) natural harbour has been curtailed by 
modern landfill (it once penetrated much further inland); at Syracuse the coastline has also changed, but not so drastically. A fragmentary inscription at 
Catana refers to building work including a moles 
(quay), perhaps in the third century, while Gaius Vibius Salutaris of Ephesus was the ‘deputy head 
of the harbours of the province of Sicily’ in AD 
103/4. No other holders of this office are however 
recorded, so we do not know whether his was a routine post or a special appointment with specific 
goals.(see p. 99 ); a bust of the cult statue of the goddess 
appears on the obverse. A full-length statue of the 
goddess, located by the letters SICIL(-ia) below it 
and probably belonging to this same temple, fea-
tures on later aurei as well. The place developed into a small roadside settlement, labelled ‘Diana’  in one of the ancient road handbooks, but has  
not yet been identified on the ground (near 
Spadafora?).
Other coastal temples were doubtless also 
familiar landmarks. The great shrine of Aphrodite/Venus on the impressive summit of Mount Eryx (now Monte Erice), which rises dramatically out 
of the flat plains of western Sicily (751  m), would 
have been visible for miles around. The cult might 
have had indigenous (Elymian) origins, but it took on a distinctly Carthaginian slant when this area 
of Sicily was under Punic control. The temple 
looks thoroughly Roman, however, on a coin of 57 BC, and was restored under the Emperor Clau-
dius in the mid-first century AD. The temple of Apollo Libystinus recorded at present-day Capo Passero, Sicily’s south-eastern point, was no doubt another major landmark; so too was the ancient 
lighthouse on Cape Pelorus (now Punta del Faro), 
the Roman Traiectus (‘Crossing-point’) north of Messana (Messina), departure point for the ferry 
to Italy. Part of the massive foundations of this 
ancient lighthouse has recently been exposed. A column topped with a statue of Neptune features on a silver coin of Sextus Pompey of c.38  BC and ROMAN SEASIDE VILLA

line here, now 300  m away, is not certain), sepa-
rated from the beach perhaps only by the Mes-

Sicily’s most important export product was 
grain, but this of course has left little trace in the 
archaeological record, although some impressive 
storehouses hint at the large quantities of agricul-
tural produce that an estate could yield: at Piazza Armerina and Gerace such buildings were over  
50 m long, symbols of the landowners’ wealth  
and power. A carbonised grain store was found in another storeroom at Gerace in 2015 , destroyed 
when a fire took hold of the villa in the fifth  century AD. Sicilian wine on tables at Rome is recorded in the ancient sources; amphoras  carrying wine from Tauromenium are attested at 
Pompeii. Amphora production for wine carriers  
of a smaller, flat-bottomed variety of later date (mid-Empire/late Roman) are also known on the 
coastal strip of nearby Naxos, conveniently located 
for an export that took the local wine all over the Roman Empire. Sicilian garum (salted fish sauce) may also have been more important than is cur-
rently realised. The familiar beach-side, mortar-
lined tanks used in garum preparation, known along many coastlines around the Mediterranean, 
occur in Sicily too, in a dozen places, none sug-
gesting a particularly large production; yet ampho-ras of the Dressel 21 /22 type, long interpreted as 
Campanian fruit-carriers, are now thought to have 
contained garum, and Sicilian production of them 
is attested by kilns located barely 500 m from the sea at Alcamo Marina. They seem to have had a 
mainly western-Mediterranean coastal distribution 
(Italy and southern Gaul), although one from Ephesus has been identified by its material as 
Sicilian, and another is known at Alexandria. 
A more specialist product was alum, used in  
the dyeing industry and also in medicine, which 
came from Lipara (now Lipari) in the Aeolian 
Islands: it was transported in a particular form of 
amphora known as Richborough 527, of which the production site, just south of Lipari town and 
close to the sea, is known. Its export was extensive 
in the western Mediterranean, especially to Italy, France and Britain, during the first and second centuries AD. Unlike the Dressel 21 /22s with  
their coastal distribution, the Richborough 527  
amphoras penetrated to many inland sites as well. Having a seaside villa where one could relax 
and entertain friends was a status symbol beloved 
by the rich elite in Italy and in many other  
provinces, and Sicily was no exception. There are fragmentary examples at Gela (a precociously early one, c.250 /200 BC), Marina di Avola, 
Taormina, Bagnoli San Gregorio and Settefrati,  all of which have yielded mosaics; there are hints too of others on the offshore islands, such as on 
Pantelleria and Basiluzzo. The most coherent 
example today is at Durrueli di Realmonte, with rooms paved in marble and mosaic around a cen-
tral courtyard, and an elaborate bath-suite along-
side. Its heyday was in the first half of the second century AD. Despite being set on the very edge of the beach, the sea is further invoked (perhaps as 
protection) by a reference to Neptune, who fea-
tures in a mosaic in its baths. Fishing, no doubt important to the Sicilian economy then as now, 
appears in a floor mosaic in another villa, at T erme 
Vigilatore, as well as in stock scenes from African copybooks at the famous inland villa of c. AD 320/ 330 near Piazza Armerina. Other direct or indirect

Amphora made in Lipara 
(now Lipari, an Aeolian  
Island), of a type which is found widely in the western half of the Roman Empire, 
as far north as Britain. Its 
distinctive shape was first recognised during excava-tions at Richborough  
(‘527’ from its catalogue 
number) in Kent (Eng-
land). It probably carried 
alum, a material used for 
medical purposes, for fix-
ing colours in textile manu-facture, and in the working 
of leather. The export trade 
in Liparian amphoras last-ed from the 1st to the 3rd 
centuries AD. Amphora,  
c. AD 150/250, max.  preserved height 60 cm. Argenton-sur-Creuse  
(central France), ancient 
Argentomagus.
Sulphur from the Agrigentum region — Sicily  
was the ancient world’s main source of sulphur 
supply — was exported at least to Rome, as epi-
graphic evidence makes clear. More curious is  
the success of another product, the coarse purplish 
to dark brown cooking ware (especially bowls, 
dishes and lidded casseroles) made on the island of 
Cossyra (present-day Pantelleria). This was expor-ted to many places in the central and western 
Mediterranean over a span of at least 500 years. 
One can only assume, to make its export economi-cally viable, that it rode ‘piggy-back’ in the gaps left 
between more valuable cargo on board. Perhaps 
grain ships from north Africa, restocking their pro-visions in Cossyra, took on this additional cargo before continuing to their intended destinations. 
One such vessel, in the fifth century AD, soon after 
leaving port, foundered at Scauri on the south side of Cossyra, where an underwater excavation has 
proved richly informative.LONG-DISTANCE TRADE 
Some of the cylindrical 
amphoras found in 1981 
in a ship which sank off Randello near Camarina  on Sicily’s west coast  
c. AD 330. Belonging to an  
amphora form known as 
Almagro 50, which was made on the west coast of 
present-day Portugal, they 
contained fish products, especially sardines but 
with some mackerel as 
well. Each amphora (there were at least 130 on board) had a capacity of 
22 litres. The amphoras 
document long-distance trade between the Atlantic coast of Portugal and the 
south coast of Sicily in  
the 4th cent.; the cargo‘s destination is of course  
unknown.Sicily’s central position in the Mediterranean 
meant that a host of goods from far and wide 
reached its shores. Most imports came unsurpris-
ingly from Italy or Africa, and in vast quantities, but oil, fish and decorated pottery from the Ibe-rian peninsula and foodstuffs, marble, lamps, and 
pottery from Greece and Asia Minor as well as 
further afield are also attested. Glassware travelled from Syria in the first century AD (such as a glass 
cup made by Ennion found at Solunto), and from 
Cologne in the fourth century (a glass flask dis-covered at Chiaramonte Gulfi). But the material 
from the many shipwrecks off Sicilian shores  
was less certainly intended for Sicilian markets. The two columns of African giallo antico marble 
off Camarina (p. 113 ), for example, may have been 
heading elsewhere, as no columns in this material have yet been found in Sicily; and the prefabri-cated pulpit kit of Proconnesian marble from 
Marzamemi (p. 127 ) is also of a type unknown in 
Sicily: it might have been on its way to an African 
church. It is also intriguing to speculate on the intended destination of the enamelled perfume 
flask that foundered in a ship off Camarina (p. 113 ). 
This handsome artefact, discovered way outside 
the usual distribution range of this distinctive dec-
orated metal-ware (north-west Europe, especially 
Britain, France, Germany and the Benelux coun-tries), had come all the way from the distant Roman province of Britannia, where a local 
industry, building on Iron Age traditions of enam-
elling, produced a wide range of these intricate and attractive products for both domestic and  
foreign markets."

The sea off Camarina in the south-east  
of Sicily witnessed the historic disasters 
in which two entire Roman fleets were lost: in 255 BC the fleet of the consuls 
Marcus Aemilius Paullus and Servius Fulvius Paetinus foundered between the site of the ancient Greek city and what is now Pachino,

Other shipwrecks along the Camarina coast 
which remained anonymous occurred in Anti-quity, during the Middle Ages and in modern times. Sicily’s south-west coast is like a Bermuda Triangle in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, where the libeccio or south-west wind combines with the geographical characteristics of the low 
and sandy coast to form a deadly trap.
Modern archaeological research is actually helped by the currents caused by the libeccio, which are able to move entire sand dunes on 
 
the sea floor overnight. Over the last decades a veritable shipwreck cemetery has been brought to light, offering precious pieces of evidence to

The island of Pantelleria in the Strait of 
Sicily, with its central location in the  
geographical and historical frame of the Mediterranean, has kept up connections 
to nearby regions since prehistoric times — one 
need only think of the distribution of obsidian. Over the last decades many shipwrecks have been discovered along its shores to attest to the continuity of these connections; the latest one, 
but not the least, is the wreck of Scauri. 
Successive excavations conducted from 1998 
 
to 2008 have brought to light the remains of a shipwreck that was buried at a depth of c.8 m 
 
on the sandy sea floor between the two piers of the Scauri marina. The ship was c.20 m long, dates from the fifth century AD, and transported a cargo of pottery produced at the Scauri settle

ment, probably destined for the nearby African coast.The small quantity of timber finds can be explained by the circumstances of the shipwreck: the hull, capsized during loading or at departure, must have been exposed to the forces of nature for a long time, and perhaps parts were salvaged 
for reuse in buildings at an early stage.
Despite the fact that the wooden structure was lost almost entirely, the discovery of a few ele
-
ments (fragments of the ship’s side, of peeled but otherwise undressed branches, and of the carrying structure) allows us to observe some particulars of the ship’s construction. They go back to the characteristics of ship construction in late Antiquity, including joints along the planking consisting of mortises that are very large in rela

vals. The Scauri wreck is a product of the last phase of the so-called shell-first system; its mixed construction type shows signs of a devel

opment toward a new approach to the structure with an almost completely ‘carrying skeleton’. The types of timber used in the ship can give 
 
us a clue as to the location of the shipyard where it was built. They all occur in the area between the French Riviera and the western Italian 
 
Riviera, and in the east of the Istrian Peninsula (in modern Croatia). Although we can’t exclude the possibility that the shipyard used imported timber, it is reasonably certain that the Scauri ship was not built in northern Africa (Tunisia). The only compatible elements are the peeled branches, which probably belonged to a damp

ing system for the cargo. We can only assume that along its route to Pantelleria, it called at a port somewhere on the Tunisian coast. Most of the ship’s cargo, 79%, consisted of local pottery known as Pantellerian ware (fourth/fifth     The Late-Roman

Beginning in 2005, the Egadi Islands  
Survey Project, a cooperative project 
between the Soprintendenza del Mare  
in Sicily and RPM Nautical Foundation, 
has surveyed over 250 km2 of sea floor around 
Levanzo and Favignana (both belonging to the Aegadian Islands, near Sicily’s north-west cape). During the investigation the team discovered 
 
a Late-Roman site, the Levanzo I wreck. Here,  
at c.3 nautical miles north of Capo Grosso, the northern tip of Levanzo, a Roman merchantman carrying a cargo of foodstuffs sank 94 m to the sea floor in the late third century AD. Measuring approximately 20 x 9 m, a moderate-sized mer

concentrated at each end of the wreck, and almost completely absent in the central space. Excavation in this central area produced several iron nails and potential wood fragments that 
 
indicate a continuous hull deposit. The lack of cargo remains points to a perishable cargo, likely grain, carried in the central hold. Other foodstuffs were contained in the relatively small number of amphoras on board; they included oil, fish prod-ucts, and wine.  Identifiable intact or nearly intact amphoras 
mostly originated from what is now Tunisia and carried oil, wine, and fish products: African 1

on board were produced in Sicily, yet the former’s production area also included northern Africa. 
 
A smaller number of amphoras from Spain were present (types Almagro 51C and Dressel 23–Tejarillo 1), as was type Knossos 18 from the eastern Mediterranean. A possible small personal consignment of tableware was also included in the cargo. Typology identifications for the flagons and plate indicate they were produced in Tunisia.

 NEW POWERS"

For much of its long, eventful, and often 
tortuous history, Sicily has fascinated the 
peoples of the Mediterranean and beyond. 
Its location at the crossroads of the Medi-
terranean along with the richness of its soils ex- plain why this has often been so. T o conquerors 
and empire-builders Sicily has always been a jewel 
in the crown. T o migrants the island has long promised to be a place where they could build 
new and meaningful lives. And for merchants this 
largest and most centrally located island of the Me di terranean has forever been an ideal place to 
ply their respective trades in the hope of making their businesses, and thus their families and com-munities, prosper. 
As a result, Sicily has invariably attracted a con-
tinuous stream of people, goods, and ideas. While this pattern was established long before Roman rule over Sicily became a reality, it continued to 
characterise the cultural and demographic history 
of the island during Roman and late Roman times, persisting well into the Middle Ages. Throughout this period the rulers of the world 
coveted the island: from being the first province  
of a budding Roman Empire, Sicily eventually became part of a political entity known as Italia 
Suburbicaria (meaning that the island was admin-
istered from the city of Rome, starting in the fourth century AD). In the course of the fifth  century AD the island began to suffer from Vandal 
raids and periodic occupation. Still later it was 
nominally subjugated by Gothic forces until finally, in the mid-sixth century, it was drawn  into the orbit of the Byzantine Empire. 
During all this time, Sicily’s intimate relation 
with the sea was never lost. Nor did the sea bring merely armies and warlords to Sicilian shores. There were long stretches of time when the  
political situation was relatively quiet and Sicily 
managed to attract in a more peaceful manner new peoples, cultures, and ideas from across the 
sea. Among these were Jews who must have found  
the island appealing as a way station between the 
numerous Jewish communities in the Near East, 
those in Roman northern Africa and the ones in 
the city of Rome itself. We do not know exactly when Jews first set foot on the island. Y et those who did soon managed to form the nucleus  
of a community that would flourish without 
interruption for almost fifteen hundred years,  until their descendants were mercilessly driven  
off the island in early 1492  on the instigation of  
Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile. 
As for Christianity — whose precise origins  
in Sicily are also shrouded in mystery — it is  
reasonable to suppose that some of the very  
same factors that benefited the Jews of Sicily  also contributed to the rise of this new religion, 
which began as an offshoot of Judaism. We know 
that the Apostle Paul is supposed to have spent three days in Syracuse whilst en route to Rome after he had appealed to the emperor. Such a  
short sojourn does not fully explain, however, the  
subsequent spread of Christian ideas in Sicily,  Jews and Christians

for example, in the south-east of the island where 
during Late Antiquity Jews can be shown to have 
worked the land as farmers and benefited from its 
proceeds as landowners. Like Judaism, Christianity initially manifested itself in port cities such as Syr-acuse and Panormus and began to spread inland 
from there, again starting in the south-eastern part 
of the island.
At this point it is important to stress that as  
this process unfolded and both groups adapted  to local circumstances, neither the Jewish nor the early Christian communities ever lost track of 
their connections to the larger outside world. 
Archaeological discoveries throughout Sicily  document the full extent to which the trade  networks that linked Sicily to the rest of the  
later Roman Empire continued to ensure the free  
transregional flow of commodities, individuals, 
and beliefs. Jewish earthenware lamps found at 
various locations in Sicily, and recognisable as such 
because they are decorated with the menorah or seven-branched candelabrum, provide us with good evidence to illustrate this point. Some of 
these lamps were imports from Roman northern 
Africa where workshops turned out, in an almost industrial fashion, huge amounts of this kind of 
red-orange glossy pottery known to specialists as 
terra sigillata. Catering to Jewish, Christian and pagan customers alike, these north-African pottery workshops quickly succeeded in securing a large 
international clientele for their products. The Jews 
of Sicily were among it. Besides, they not only imported them, they also frequently imitated them as this development must have drawn its nourish-
ment from other sources as well. 
One possible such source that bears on the  
rise of Christianity in Sicily is precisely the Jewish community on the island. Archaeologists have 
long noted that during the third and fourth cen-turies AD Jewish and Early-Christian archaeologi-cal evidence on Sicily is located in such close 
proximity to one another as to justify the conclu-
sion of cordial relations between the two groups. Some have even gone so far as to argue that both 
communities intermingled during this period  
to the extent of forming new, thoroughly mixed or so-called syncretistic groups. While such a  
conclusion does not hold in light of the archaeo-
logical evidence currently available, it is clear all the same that throughout Antiquity Sicilian Jews and Sicilian Christians interacted continuously 
with one another because both groups were  
operating within the same larger social, political, and economic frameworks.
Most remarkable about this larger framework  
is that as soon as the ancient evidence becomes truly tangible and consistent — that is, from the 
third century AD onwards — the Jewish and 
Christian communities of Sicily can be shown  to have developed along similar lines, at least in a number of respects. Jews first settled in cities with 
port facilities such as Syracuse, Catana (modern 
Catania), Tauromenium (Taormina), Messana (Messina), Panormus (Palermo), and Agrigentum (Agrigento). It was from these cities that Judaism 
subsequently spread to the interior. This happened, "
"123JEWS AND CHRISTIANS IN LATE ANTIQUITY
CATACOMBS OF SAN  
GIOVANNI, SYRACUSE 
The Acradina district in 
Syracuse has since Roman times been devoted to the dead. The Catacombs of 
San Giovanni were created 
in the 4th and 5th cent.  as a cemetery for the  
city’s substantial Christian 
community. The cata-combs, estimated to house some 10,000 burials, were 
cut into the limestone rock  
and incorporated an older 
water-supply system.Of all the finds available, it is the funerary 
inscriptions that speak the clearest language as  
to how, throughout the entire Roman period, the 
sea enabled the Jewish and Christian communities of Sicily to stay in touch with the outside world. Thus, early Christian inscriptions from the cata-
combs of Syracuse tell us that among the people 
buried there were those who had originated  from major administrative centres on the Italian 
mainland, including Rome, Mediolanum (modern 
Milan), and Aquileia. Y et there were others who, significantly, had migrated to Sicily from places 
much further away: the city of Constantinople,  
for example, and various towns and villages in  the Roman province of Syria, which included the coastal strip we now know as Lebanon. Surely it is 
no coincidence that these very same inscriptions 
finally also inform us that some of these people made their living as naukleroi, that is, from being 
engaged in the shipping business. Incidentally, 
Jewish evidence from Sicily hints at very similar patterns.
As Antiquity drew to a close, the Jews of Sicily 
switched from Greek to Hebrew in their inscrip-tions, while the Christians switched from Greek to Latin. Such a divergence in language is indica-
tive of a larger and rather fundamental change that 
started to materialise in the relationship between these two groups. Y et even as both communities increasingly began to go their own way, their 
respective relationship with the sea remained as 
strong as ever.using local clay — yet another indicator of how 
popular imports from northern Africa really  
were during the fourth and early fifth centuries.
Further examples abound of how the sea and 
sea-born commerce played a crucial role in 
embedding the people of Sicily into a larger  
world in which international exchange and  
interconnectivity were key. They include a truly splendid early Christian sarcophagus known as  
the Sarcophagus of Adelphia. Now on display in 
the Regional Archaeological Museum Paolo Orsi at Syracuse, this extraordinary piece of marble 
relief sculpture from Late Antiquity was originally 
discovered in the early Christian catacombs of  San Giovanni in Syracuse. In addition to showing the deceased couple in a central panel that has 
been shaped as an enormous shell, this sarcopha-
gus displays the full range of iconographical motifs typical of early Christian art, including scenes 
from the life of Jesus but also representations based 
on the Hebrew Bible, starting, in the lower right section, with a rendering of Adam and Eve in  Paradise. The material point about this work of art 
is that once again we are not dealing with a locally 
produced item, but rather with an import that originated from a sarcophagus workshop in 
Rome. What this piece indicates, therefore, is  
that among Sicily’s early Christians there were those who travelled enough to know that this kind of product was available, and connected and 
financially secure enough to have it transported 
over land and sea, all the way from Rome to Sicily."

    Syracuse in 
 the Byzantine 
                 PeriodWIM AERTS
Beauty as a burden. The marvellous island 
of Sicily is situated at a strategic location 
in the Mediterranean. Its three corners 
look to the east (Greece), to the west 
(Spain) and to the south (Tunisia). It is no wonder that from early times on invaders came from these 
three directions. Doric-speaking Greeks founded 
colonies as early as the eighth century BC; Athe-nians tried — in vain — to conquer the important 
seaport of Syracuse during the Peloponnesian War; Carthaginians and Romans fought for hegemony from the fifth to the second century BC. After the 
fall of the western part of the Roman Empire, 
Sicily was of strategic importance in the attempts of the Byzantines to reconquer the west. The city and harbour of Syracuse played an important part 
in this process.
In the war against the Goths the Emperor  
Justinian (ruled AD 527–565 ) had sent his general 
Belisarius to conquer Sicily, which would serve as 
a springboard to control the region of Carthage. The account of the Byzantine historian Procopius (c. AD 500–after 553 ) of the conquest of Syracuse 
gives a good impression of the situation of the city, its harbour and the importance of the sea:
Belisarius sailed to Sicily and took Catana. From there he easily persuaded Syracuse and the other cities to recognise his dominance. Only the Goths who guarded Panormus  
put their trust in their city’s well-secured 
wall and had no intention whatsoever of surrendering to Belisarius; they summoned 
him to retreat with his army as soon as pos-
sible. Belisarius was aware of the fact that it was impossible to invade the city from land and ordered that the fleet sail into the har-
bour close to the city wall. This was located 
outside the stronghold and totally undefen-ded.
As the troops came into the harbour it became 
clear that the masts of their ships reached higher 
than the top of the wall. Belisarius had his archers 
lifted into the masts, from where they chased  away the defenders. The Goths reportedly were  so im pressed that they immediately handed over 
the city to Belisarius. 
Another indication of the important position 
of Syracuse is given in the same context. It was 
the intention of the Byzantines to gain control 
over the region around Carthage in order to intervene in the controversy between the ortho-dox Christians and adherents of Arian’s doctrine. 
Information about that region was much needed, 
which Belisarius received by chance. While Pro co-
pius (who worked for Belisarius and was more 
than just an historiographer) was conducting  
business in Syracuse, he met an old friend there, whose slave had just returned from the African coast. According to his information nobody in 
Carthage was aware of the possibility of an attack 
on Carthaginian territory, as the commander was campaigning in Sardinia.

The Castello Maniace 
guards the entrance to  
the harbour of Syracuse. The first fort was built  here by General George 
Maniaces after he had 
captured Syracuse from the Arabs in 1040. The  elegant ruins of castle  
and defences that are  
visible today were built by Emperor Frederick II.

campaign he grew a beard and was nicknamed 
‘Pogonatus’ (‘with the beard’). It is said that during 
his reign the so-called Greek fire was invented  and used to set enemy ships on fire. 
In the course of the ninth century the Byzan-
tine Empire faced dangers from several directions in the Balkans and Italy. The first serious invasion from the Arabs and Berbers into Sicily dates from 
827. The commander of the fleet of the thema 
(district) of Sicily, Euphemius, had executed a  raid against northern Africa, but was dismissed  
by the Byzantine emperor, Michael III (842–867 ).  
He then proclaimed himself emperor, with Syra-
cuse as capital. In Soussa (Libya) he sought help from the Arabs, but they were preparing a large-
scale attack on Sicily and ignored Euphemius’ 
request. The Arab attack on Syracuse failed, but in the following decades the Saracens conquered 
Palermo (831 ), Messina (843), Cefalù, and Enna 
(858–859). Syracuse was finally taken in 878 after  
a siege of nine months.
The Byzantine fleet sent to rescue the besieged 
city came too late. The Byzantine sources offer 
two different explanations for its failure to be  on time. Georgius Monachus remarks that the 
Emperor Basil I (ruled 867 –886) was building a 
‘New Church’ in the palace out of gratitude for 
gaining the throne, for which he needed the  men of his fleet. Although he had been told  Some generations later, the state of affairs in  
the Mediterranean had changed radically. Byzan-
tine naval power was challenged by the Islamised 
Arabs, who had built a fleet of their own, opening the possibility to launch attacks against Constan-tinople. This threat made the Emperor Constans II 
(ruled 641 –668) consider moving his residence 
from Constantinople to Syracuse (and from there 
to the old capital, Rome). While residing in Syra-
cuse, he ordered his wife and three sons to leave 
Constantinople and join him. The inhabitants of Constantinople, however, protested and did not 
allow them to depart. Not much later, Constans 
led a fleet to attack the Arabs, but was sorely defeated. An anecdote in the Historia syntomos  (a chronicle ascribed to Michael Psellus, c.1017 –
1096) tells us that Constans had a curious dream 
before he went to battle: 
In his dream he was transported to Thessa-lonica. One of the interpreters of dreams  to whom the emperor submitted his dream told him that he would lose the war against 
the Arabs, for this was made clear by the 
name of Thessalonica: ‘Leave (thes) to the other (allo) the victory (nica).’
Constans was later murdered in the bathhouse 
of Syracuse named Daphne. His son and successor 
Constantine IV (ruled 668 –6 85) went over to  "
"126After the conquest of Syracuse in 878 the  
Byzantines reacted with counter-attacks against  
all the regions in Italy that were under Arabic 
control or might be threatened by the Arabs. The revival of Byzantine power under the emperors Nicephorus Phocas II (963–969), John Tzimisces 
(969–976 ), and Basil II (976 -1025 ) took place in 
primarily the Balkans and the Middle East. Only 
after Basil’s death (1025 ) were new attempts made 
to recover Sicily, culminating in the conquest of Syracuse in 1040 . Rebellions in the Byzantine 
army gave the Arabs the opportunity to regain 
their power on the island. Only Messina remained 
in Byzantine hands.
After 1041  young Norman adventurers seeking 
employment arrived and with the help of local 
authorities established their influence in important 
cities in southern Italy, setting foot on Sicily as well. One of them, Robert Guiscard (1015 –1085 ), 
was invested by the pope as duke of Apulia and Calabria in 1059 . In the following years the  
continuing Norman influx led to the expulsion  of the Byzantine forces from all of Italy. Bari, the 
last Byzantine city, was taken in 1071 . Guiscard 
started the invasion of Sicily in 1061 ; in 1072   
he conquered Palermo, and Syracuse in 1086. Guiscard’s younger brother Roger was invested as 
count of Sicily (1071 –1101 ), which could only be 
brought under control after 1085 . He established  
a Latin bishopric in Syracuse. Under his rule a 
reasonable equilibrium existed between Catholic, 
Orthodox and Muslim communities. His succes-sor, Roger II (1095 –1154 , count of Sicily from 
1105 and king from 1130 ), diminished the Muslim 
element and created a Latinised Norman society. Under his rule Sicily became an important centre 
for trade and communication, supported by a 
powerful fleet. Palermo was the centre of  government, but Syracuse the major harbour.about the state of affairs in Sicily, he delayed 
embarking on an expedition to Sicily, preferring 
to continue with the building of the church; when the ships were finally ready to leave, the  
fall of Syracuse could no longer be prevented. 
Another explanation blames the adverse weather and the inadequacy with which Admiral Hadrian handled the ensuing situation. After sailing from 
Constantinople, the fleet was retained in Monem-
basia on the Peloponnese because of unfavourable weather and awaited prosperous winds for the  
passage to Sicily. Hadrian was unwilling to put  
out to sea if the advance of the fleet depended on oarsmen alone. By the time he was ready to sail, the city of Syracuse was already in the hands of 
the Arabs. 
One of the prisoners taken by the Arabs was 
the monk Theodosius, who during his imprison-ment wrote a poem about the siege and occupa-
tion of the city. It remained unknown until the Sicilian Jesuit and historian Ottavio Gaetani,  
who was born in Syracuse in 156 6 , transcribed  
the poem in his posthumously published Isagoge  
ad Historiam Siculam (Introduction to Sicilian History, Palermo, 1708). The first verses read: 
The people of Ismael surrounded the city of Syracuse, attacked it from all sides and con-
quered the city. It launched a treacherous 
attack, came sailing along with its ships and took the city after ten months of siege.BYZANTINE TROOPS

The Marzamemi II shipwreck was discov-ered by Gerard Kapitän and Pier Nicola Gargallo in 1960 /1961. Collaborating  
with Dr. Heinz Wilms-Posen from Bonn, 
Kapitän further researched the hull and the cargo during excavation campaigns in 1964, 1965, and 1967. These campaigns 
brought to light twenty-eight column  
bases, twenty-seven Corinthian capitals with two leaf crowns of the Lederblätter 
type, numerous column shafts, and  
fragments that belonged to a pluteus  (parapet). The ship was carrying a cargo of architectural elements and sacral furniture 
destined for the western Mediterranean 
that can be dated to the first half of the 
sixth century AD.  
Practically the entire stone cargo consisted of Proconnesian marble (Proconnesus  being the present-day island of Marmara, 
Turkey) — a testimony to the still-flourishing 
production and export of architectural  
decoration from the imperial quarries to the capitals of the West in the time of  
Justinian (ruled 527–565), particularly to 
Ravenna, Rome and the African cities where Byzantine governors resided. It is hardly likely that Sicily was the cargo’s  final destination. The destination of this prefabricated 
church probably lay in Africa. The ambo 
(pulpit) is different from the rest of the  cargo in that it is made of green porphyry from Thessaly; it consists of an elevated  
elliptical platform supported by half-col-
umns, provided with parapets and accessi-ble by two opposing stairways that were protected by trapezium-shaped tiles. 
Moulded cornices divide the parapet into three panels decorated with a Latin cross 
in the centre. The same motif is repeated on the trapezium-shaped tiles to the sides 
of the parapet.  
Although made from a different material, 
the ambo presents technical and stylistic 
characteristics that are typical of the work-shops at Constantinople, like the rest of the cargo. This justifies the hypothesis that 
all the stone materials came from the 
same workshop. This would lead to the conclusion that workshops manufactured architectural elements on commission 
from particularly rich (imperial?) parties, 
not only from local marble but also from specially imported pieces.

In the year 827 the political and religious elite 
of Ifrı ¯qiya — the former Roman province of 
Africa — met in Kairouan (in present-day  
Tunisia) to discuss a complicated matter of state 
interest. Formally, Ifrı ¯qiya was an integral part of the Abbasid Caliphate, ruled from its capital  
Baghdad. In reality, many of the peripheral regions 
of the caliphate were led by semi-autonomous governors, local warlords or military commanders. 
Such was the case with Ifrı ¯qiya. Since the year  
800 a dynasty of emirs, the Aghlabids, named after  
its founder Ibra ¯hı ¯m b. al-Aghlab, had controlled 
the province. 
Later Arabic chronicles picture the arrival of  
a Sicilian officer in Ifrı ¯qiya as the direct cause  
of the meeting in Kairouan. This Sicilian, whom  
we know as Fı ¯mı ¯ in the Arabic sources and as 
Euphemios in Greek, is presented as a rebel, who murdered the Byzantine strategos (governor) of 
Sicily in 826 and pronounced himself leader, but 
was soon after betrayed by one of his subordinates and fled to Ifrı ¯qiya for help. 
The topic of the meeting in 827 was Fı ¯mı ¯’s 
request for help. The main issue, as later sources with obvious hindsight present it, seems to have been whether the Aghlabids should colonise or 
simply continue raiding the island of Sicily. The 
Arabic chronicler al-Nuwayrı ¯ (d. 1333 ) summa-
rised the discussion as follows:
Some of them said, ‘We can raid it, but we should not colonise it, nor should we take it as our homeland.’  Then Sah˙nu ¯n b. Qa ¯dim 
(upon whom God has had mercy) said, 
‘How far is it between there and the lands of 
the Christians?’  They replied, ‘A man could go and return twice or three times in a day.’ He asked, ‘And to the area of Ifrı ¯qiya?’ And 
they replied, ‘A day and a night.’ So he said, 
‘If I were a bird, I would not fly over there!’ But some of the others advised to attack it, 
which is what they preferred, and so they 
quickly set to it. (transl. Alex Metcalfe)
Accordingly, a fleet of a hundred ships left the 
north-African coast at Sousse (Tunisia) and landed 
at Mazara on the west coast of Sicily. The invasion of Sicily had begun and although decades of battle 
and resistance still lay ahead, in the end the island 
would be added to the long list of early Islam’s great conquests. 
LOOTING AND IDOLS
The landing of Aghlabid ships in 827 was, however, not Sicily’s first encounter with Islam. T wenty 
years after the death of the Prophet Mu hammad, 
in 652, Muslim raiders first attacked the coasts of 
Sicily, then in Byzantine hands. 
 The governor of Syria, Mu‘a ¯wiya b. Abı ¯ Sufya ¯n 
(d. 680, Umayyad caliph from 661 ), had ordered 
the building of a fleet to protect the Syrian coast against Byzantine aggression in the forties of the 
seventh century. A few years later he sent these 
ships to Sicily, probably with the sole intention to The Arab Conquest

Islam spread quickly 
across the Mediterranean, but in Sicily the Arabs’ 
conquest was a slow one. 
Palermo, which as Balarm 
was to become the seat of 
an emirate in 948, fell in 
831. Messina was taken in 
843. Enna (the Arabs’ 
Qa.sryannih, also an emir -
ate) was conquered in 
858. With the violent fall of 
Syracuse in 878, the con-
quest was essentially com-
plete, though Taormina 
and several other moun-taintop communities held 
out for a few more years.

loot the island known for its riches. And so they 
did. Arabic sources relate — often with a sense of 
shame — that when these ships left they took on 
board not only slaves, but also statues of gold and silver crowned with jewels. The latter were trans-ported to India over Basra and fetched good 
prices from worshippers there.
It was not compassion with the Christian 
inhabitants of Sicily who had to miss their cult statues that embarrassed Muslim authors. The  
controversy, widely discussed by authors such as the famous al-Biru ¯nı ¯ (d. 1048 ), was about the  
selling of idols to idolaters who would conse-quently be driven towards polytheism. It is also true, however, that these later authors are well known for their anti-Umayyad propaganda and 
this story might have been invented in that vein. 
Throughout the first half of the eighth century 
the raiding of Sicily, its neighbouring islands and the Italian coasts continued, instigated mainly 
from the north-African coasts. Unlike the Iberian Peninsula, most of which was conquered and 
annexed at the beginning of the eighth century, 
the Italian coasts were attacked in a relatively  haphazard way. The intention seems to have been 
to plunder, not to conquer. The attacks were less 
frequent in the second half of the eighth century, when northern Africa faced internal revolts by Berber tribes.
CONQUEST
With the arrival of the Aghlabid governors in Ifrı ¯qiya and their restoration of central authority, 
fleets from northern Africa again targeted the  
Italian coasts and its neighbouring islands. While the Aghlabid rulers organised some, other raids seem to have been private undertakings. Bari,  
for example, was ruled by emirs with a Berber 
background for about thirty years. Rome was  also infamously plundered in this period.
Although Arab sources tell us that the occasion 
for conquering Sicily in the early ninth century was the request for help from the Sicilian dissident 
Fı ¯mı ¯, the underlying motives must be sought 
elsewhere. Despite their repression of the initial Berber revolts, the Aghlabids again faced a series of internal problems in the 820s. The economy of 
Ifrı ¯qiya was in constant pressing need of low-cost 
labourers for the large estates of the political and military elites. New conquests would further the 
supply of slaves, which had otherwise run dry. In 
addition, the Aghlabids faced internal opposition from two influential groups: religious scholars  and rebel factions within the army. The Muslim 
religious elite, especially the jurists, denounced  
the Aghlabids for their licentious lifestyle and their ‘illegal’, in the sense of non-Islamic, taxes. With a 
jiha ¯d against infidels the rulers hoped to silence 
their criticism and by focusing on a common enemy they hoped to redirect internal factional strife among army regiments. 
BASTARDS LIVING IN A LAND OF JIHA ¯D
The annexation of Sicily took place in phases.  It started in the south-west of the island. Soon 
most of the west was in the hands of the Muslim 
armies; Palermo became their capital. The invasion of the eastern part, however, met with more vary-ing degrees of success. Messina was conquered rel-
atively soon in the years 842–843, but the Muslim "

Similarly gloomy is Ibn Hawqal’s report of the Sicilian Muslims inhabiting this frontier island 
when he says:
Most people are bastardised Muslims and think it is acceptable to marry Christians  
on the basis that their male child follows  the father by being a bastardised Muslim, while the female child becomes a Christian 
like her mother. They do not pray, do not 
perform ritual ablutions, they do not pay  the alms tax nor do they go on pilgrimage 
[to Mecca]. (transl. Alex Metcalfe)
Listening to Ibn Hawqal we should take into 
account his sympathies for the high ideals of the 
Shia Ismaili cause of the Fatimid rulers of north-
ern Africa, and, accordingly, his biases against the, in his eyes, degenerated inhabitants of Sicily at the 
fringes of the da ¯r al-isla ¯m (House of Islam, area 
under the rule of Islam). Either way, his account emphasises processes of acculturation between Christian and Muslim inhabitants of the island.
TWICE OR THREE TIMES A DAY
On the eve of the invasion in Sicily, at the meet-ing in Kairouan in 827, a certain Sah˙nu ¯n b. Qa ¯dim 
is said to have expressed his doubts and reserva-tions about the conquest of this faraway island (see above, p. 128 ). His main argument was that while 
the north-African coast was a day and night away, 
‘a man could go and return two or three times in 
a day’ to the land of the Christians, the Italian mainland. In the end these considerations turned 
out to be wise and far-sighted. Controlling Sicily 
was possible as long as the Christian powers in the south of Italy were divided and weak. When in 
the middle of the eleventh century the Normans 
united forces in the southern peninsula and subse-quently crossed the Strait of Messina, two and a half centuries of Islamic rule came to an end. armies hardly gained a foothold in its mountain-
ous hinterland. In the south-east the city of Syra-
cuse remained a stronghold of the Byzantines until 878. 
In fact, some Arabic sources emphasise that  
the conquest of Sicily was never fully completed and that it remained a frontier zone throughout its history. The famous Arab geographer Ibn Hawqal 
(d. after 988 ), who visited Sicily in 973 , noted:

"131MEDIEVAL SICILY: AN ISLAND OPEN ON ALL SIDES
The influence of the sea reaches deep into 
the interior of Sicily, even though it is the 
largest island in the Mediterranean. For 
many centuries, this has been expressed 
through the export from the Sicilian interior of large amounts of good-quality wheat, which sup-
plied, at various times, the cities of ancient Greece, 
republican and imperial Rome, the Muslim cities on the facing shores of northern Africa, the great 
commercial cities of medieval and Renaissance Medieval Sicily:

Italy (notably Genoa and Florence), and the 
coastal towns of Catalonia. The influence of the 
sea can also be detected in the very varied popula-
tion that settled on the island over the centuries. But this extraordinary mix of population also gen-erated a society in which different ethnic and reli-
gious groups co-existed, not always happily but 
often very fruitfully, as one can see from the expe-riences of the Sicilians under Norman, Angevin, 
and Aragonese rule.FRUIT TREES IN THE

SICILY AND THE SEA  NEW POWERS
In the mid-eleventh century the Byzantine 
general George Maniaces landed in Sicily, and  
for a time it seemed that he was making progress 
against its Arab rulers. By then, these rulers were themselves nominally dependent on the Zirid Berber dynasty in what is now Tunisia, although 
they spent a good deal of time fighting one 
another. They thus opened the door to conquest by the Norman rulers of southern Italy, who ably 
exploited these divisions, winning Palermo in 
1072. By 1130 , when Roger II de Hauteville was 
crowned king of Sicily and southern Italy, the 
island had become the base for a great fleet that 
managed to create a vast cordon sanitaire in the waters around Sicily: Roger’s chief minister and naval commander, George of Antioch, launched 
raids on Corfu and even Thebes in the 1140 s, as 
well as masterminding the conquest of a line of 
towns along the facing coast of northern Africa, 
notably the great entrepôt of Mahdia (Tunisia), 
Tripoli (Libya), and Sousse (Tunisia). 
This African dominion (Roger even called 
himself ‘king of Africa’) only lasted a dozen years, 
but over the centuries one ruler after another 
attempted to establish bases in Africa, whether  in Tunis under Charles I (1270), on the island of 
Jerba off the Tunisian coast (repeatedly), or in 
Tripoli (under Emperor Charles V in the early  sixteenth century). The prominent role played  by Roger’s chief minister (‘emir of emirs’) in  
naval operations gave rise to the use of the term ammiratus, ‘admiral’, to describe supreme naval 
commanders. In the early thirteenth century,  
the admiral of Sicily, Henry Count of Malta,  
was a reformed Genoese corsair who entered  the service of Emperor Frederick II, having  
earlier failed to conquer Crete.
Even when it still was under Muslim rule, 
Palermo had been the target of a major raid by the 
Pisan navy as the north-Italian cities began to claim 
dominion over the T yrrhenian Sea first and then 
the seas beyond. In the eleventh century it was one of the great trading cities of the Mediterranean,  
a focal point for the trade of the Jewish merchants based in Old Cairo (or Fustat, Egypt), whose busi-ness letters, now mainly preserved in Cambridge, 
shed brilliant light on the maritime trade not just  
of the Mediterranean but also of the Indian Ocean. 
Thanks to these capable businessmen, spices were transported all the way from what is now Indonesia 
and India, past Aden, through Cairo and Alexandria, 
to Sicily and its close trading partners in the region, notably the city of Mahdia in modern Tunisia, 
which was a terminus for the all-important gold 
caravans that crossed the vast expanse of the Sahara, bound for Mediterranean shores.
Out of gold dust carried on the backs of camels 
the Muslim and subsequently the Norman rulers of Sicily minted their gold coins (the tarì) or quar-ter-dinars, made of two-thirds gold. In return, the 
Sicilians sent raw cotton to Mahdia and its neigh-
bours such as Tunis, where it was processed into cloth. Sicily and what is now Tunisia existed in 
close symbiosis, and this relationship continued 
after the Norman conquest of the island. Grain continued to flow from Sicily to northern Africa, whose once-rich wheat fields were suffering from 
desiccation and abandonment, possibly as a result 
of Arab raids in the years around 110 0 .
Gradually, the maritime trade of Sicily was 
directed northwards as the Genoese, Pisans and Venetians opened up the Mediterranean to  Christian shipping in the age of the crusades, and as they identified Sicily as the prime source of 
high-quality wheat that they needed to satisfy the 
hunger of their own citizens. The more successful they were in feeding their citizens, the more  
people were attracted to their cities: the grain 
trade grew exponentially. Sicily became drawn into the trade networks of western Europe, and its ARABO-NORMAN

involvement with northern Africa and the Middle 
East was somewhat reduced.
This increasing detachment from the Islamic 
world was also expressed demographically during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as migrants arrived from the Italian peninsula, southern 
France and other Latin lands. They displaced the 
Muslim inhabitants — sometimes violently — and many Muslims emigrated, converted to Christian-
ity or indeed were killed, notably during a lengthy 
rebellion at the end of the twelfth and the start  of the thirteenth century. This culminated in the 
deportation of the remaining Sicilian Muslims to 
Lucera in southern Italy during the reign of Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (ruled 
1220–1250 ). Although he is celebrated for his 
interest in the learning of the Islamic world and 
for his use of Muslim (or ‘Saracen’) troops, and  his harem, Frederick showed no mercy to the 
Muslim rebels; by the end of his reign the Latin  
or Catholic identity of the island had been greatly reinforced. One should not confuse the culture at court, where scholars of many backgrounds were 
welcome (particularly under Roger II, count of 
Sicily from 1105  and king from 1130 ) with the stark reality of increasing tension between reli-
gious groups in the countryside and in the cities. 
However, there were still many Greeks living in 
eastern Sicily and a good many Jews lived on the 
island as well. They took over from the Muslims their role as translators of Arabic texts and as culti-
vators of plants such as henna and indigo that had 
previously been an Arab speciality. In another cor-ner of the kingdom of Sicily something distinctive 
also remained from the Arab past: Malta was part 
of the kingdom, and its Muslim population disap-peared during the thirteenth century as the island 
was Christianised — but what persisted was the 
Arabic language, which is the basis of Maltese to 
this day. Arabic also long remained the daily lan-
guage of the Jews of Sicily, expelled by Ferdinand 
of Aragon in 1492–3.
Another transformation that came by way of 
the sea was the attachment of Sicily to the Cata-lan-Aragonese world in the late thirteenth cen-tury. Cataclysmic conflicts between Frederick II and his son on the one hand and the papacy on 
the other culminated in 1262  in the award of the 
crown of Sicily and southern Italy to Charles I of 
Anjou (1227–1285 ), the brother of the French FREDERICK II

king Louis IX (St Louis). Charles only visited the 
island during the disastrous crusade against Tunis 
during which Louis died, in 1270; but his neglect 
of Sicily and the transfer of the centre of govern-ment to the mainland, especially Naples, fuelled resentment among the Sicilians and gave rise to 
the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282.
The rebels shook off Charles’s rule and, looking 
for a protector, turned to the king of Aragon, Peter III (ruled 1276–1285 ), ruler also of Catalonia;

Catalan forces entered the island by way of the seaport of Trapani, setting off a twenty-year war against Charles I and his dynasty. Naval engage-
ments between the Catalans, led by the talented 
admiral Roger de Lauria, and their Angevin rivals helped secure Aragonese control of the island 
(though it was granted to a cadet line of kings, and 
was only brought under the sovereignty of the king of Aragon at the start of the fifteenth century). 
Despite occasional tiffs between the kings of 
Aragon and the Aragonese kings of Sicily, the  rising city of Barcelona was a major market for Sicilian products, especially grain, and this connec-
tion was already in place before the revolt of the 
Vespers brought the island its first Aragonese king. How far the Catalan merchants influenced the

THE SICILIAN VESPERS 
According to one tradition, 
the direct cause of the  
Sicilians’ revolt against  the French in 1282 was the Frenchman Drouet’s 
insulting the nameless 
bride of Ruggiero Mastran-gelo from Palermo. Mas-trangelo killed Drouet, 
whose comrades came  
to avenge him and were killed by the crowd, start-
ing a call for revenge on 
the oppressors as the  Vesper bells rang. Vespri Siciliani, scene 3 by

1882); oil on canvas,  225 x 300 cm, 1846.king of Aragon’s decision to invade in 1282 is a 
moot point. So too is the question whether they 
turned the island into an economic colony that 
they shared with their traditional business rivals, the Genoese. Current thinking tends to emphasise the prosperity of the island at the end of the Mid-
dle Ages, even taking into account the enormous 
economic shock of the Black Death, which may have carried away half the population of the Med-
iterranean within two or three years; for the first 
place in western Europe to suffer from the plague was Messina, where disease-ridden ships from the 
Black Sea arrived in 1347 .
Sitting astride the central Mediterranean  
therefore had its perils as well as its advantages. 
The exposure of the island on all sides made it the 
target of invaders from every direction: Catalans 
from the west, Arabs from the south, Byzantines from the east, Normans and Angevins from the 
north — and plague bacilli from the east as well. 
The island’s openness to the Mediterranean also 
brought it prosperity, though the main beneficiar-ies were undoubtedly its rulers and its merchants, 
rather than the peasants toiling in the fields that 
produced its excellent wheat. This openness also made possible the cultural mixing visible in the 
Palatine Chapel at Palermo with its Byzantine, 
Romanesque, and Arabic features placed side by side. That, admittedly, marks the high point of  cultural vitality on the island, under the benign 
rule of King Roger II, at a time when the island 
was still enjoying close cultural and economic links with northern Africa. But Sicily never en ti-
rely lost its identity as a bridge between different Mediterranean cultures, which asserted their  
influence over the island: those of Byzantium and 
Islam, and those of Spain and Italy. "

Sicily in the Middle Ages was a consum-
mation devoutly to be wished  —  and a 
consummation it became for the dynasty of Norman warlords who had started 
spectacularly to conquer southern Italy from the early eleventh century onwards: it eventually 
brought them a crown. The eleventh-century his-
torian Goffredo Malaterra, one of three contem-porary historians recording the rise of the Nor-
man domination of southern Italy and Sicily, has 
Roger of Hauteville (c.1031 –1101 ) sitting in Reg-
gio Calabria with his elder and more famous 
brother Robert Guiscard, pleasantly resting from 
the labours of subduing Calabria and eyeing the magical island, glimmering across the Strait of Messina: 
observing it on the other side from that  narrow strip of water, Roger, always avid  
for domination, was seized by ambition to 
acquire it, thinking it would benefit both to his soul and indeed to his body if he could restore that land to correct divine worship. 
Fighting Lombards, Byzantines and even papal 
troops in turn in Apulia and Calabria had been 
advantageous enough for the Normans and had 
brought Robert the title of duke. Y et fighting the infidel in Sicily meant undying glory, and the gratitude of the pope. With the island’s possession, 
the Normans gained both the respectability asso-
ciated with the defence of the true faith and the lustre of royalty when Roger’s son Roger II  was anointed king of Sicily in Palermo in 1130 .
When Robert and Roger had their seaside 
conversation, Sicily was still ruled by rivalling  Saracen lords, whose incessant quarrelling appar-ently gave the Normans the leverage to infiltrate 
the island. Nevertheless, the Arabs were having 
quite a good time on the island, if we are to believe the Arab poet Ibn Hamdis. A Muslim  refugee from Syracuse after its capture by the 
Normans in 1072 , he in old age and exile still

O sea, you conceal beyond your further 
shores a veritable paradise (…) there, in the 
dawn of my life, I saw the sun in its glory 
(…) O that I could embark on the crescent moon, fly to the shores of Sicily and there crush myself against the breast of the sun! 
If the Normans thus inherited a paradise on earth, it is their great achievement not to have spoilt it. 
Norman rule lasted from the seventies of the elev-
enth century to the last years of the twelfth, when it merged into that of the Hohenstaufens. The 
splendour of the court of Frederick II (ruled 1220–1250) in Palermo, it is not always fully realised, was 
essentially a continuation of what his Norman an -ce stors had achieved. Since they in their turn had 
made intelligent use of what they found when 
replacing the Arabs, and the latter had done the 
same when they succeeded the Byzantines, conti-
nuity appears to be the key to understanding medi-eval Sicily. Greek, for instance, was still a major lan-guage in Arab Sicily and would remain so under 
Norman, Latin rule. Thus a unique continuity 
between Greek, Arab, and Latin evolved, resulting in a more or less trilingual status in the twelfth  
century. Ethnically many lines came together as "
"137DREAMS OF HARMONY: MULTICULTURALISM AND NORMAN SICILYCEFALU CATHEDRAL 
According to tradition,  
the cathedral of Cefalù  
was built by King Roger II in fulfilment of a vow to the Saviour in a storm; Roger 
had safely reached the 
shore of Cefalù. The cathe-dral’s impressive original architecture is Norman, 
while the splendid decora-
tion inside is mostly Byzan-tine. Roger and his wife were entombed here.
the creation of, for instance, the stupendous Arab  
ceiling of the Palermitan Royal Chapel, the Cap-
pella Palatina. But perhaps it is too facile to attrib-
ute to pragmatism alone what in fact resulted in a remarkably, almost movingly elegant fusion of two highly diverse stylistic registers. Another side to 
the Arabo-Norman style may very well have been 
the symbolic content of the co-existence in it of different and diverse cultural traditions: accommo-
dating different constituent parts of a realm that 
aspired to world rule at the time may have been intended to signify their harmonisation and syn-
thesis in Norman rule.
Another consequence of cultural interaction 
was the employment of Arab administrative sys-
tems and offices. The influence of Arab traditions 
in this respect is still attested by the etymology of 
words such as ‘admiral’ and douane (‘customs’) —  although Venice has played its role in this develop-
ment as well. The Norman kings’ habit of ruling 
through a ‘grand-vizier’ may be ascribed to this influence as well. So Roger II (king of Sicily 1130–1154 ) ruled through his admiral George of 
Antioch (d. c.1151 ), who received training and cul-
ture in Byzantium before rising to eminence in Palermo. George has immortalised himself pros-
trate for the Virgin as the donor of the Martorana. 
Amidst the unheard-of splendour of the mosaics of the Martorana George’s apparent self-abase-well, Norman, Lombard and Hohenstaufen immi-grants adding to the existing amalgam.
The pinnacles of what we now call Norman 
culture in Sicily are still world-famous, and rightly so: between the eleventh and the thirteenth cen-tury the island experienced an unprecedented 
flowering and cultural bravura, to which the 
ca thedrals of Monreale and Cefalù, the remarkable 
garden-palaces of La Zisa and La Cuba in Paler-
 mo, and the mosaics of the Cappella Palatina and 
the Martorana (also in Palermo) still bear witness. The key note of contemporary Sicilian culture, 
moreover, has a surprisingly modern ring: inter-
culturality, integration and even, to a certain degree, tolerance.
The Normans showed an admirable lack of 
cultural bias and prejudice when taking over, appropriating and adapting local Sicilian adminis-trative traditions, but perhaps this was most of all 
due to a sober and pragmatic attitude. Whatever 
their motive, the consequences of the resulting cultural interaction were highly remarkable. One, quite well-known, was the development of the 
Arabo-Norman or Siculo-Norman style of archi-
tecture, with its alternation of Arab architectural and floral motifs with Norman iconography, bulk, 
and dimension; this was due at least in part to  
the presence of highly qualified Arab workshops in Sicily and Norman willingness to use them in "

torians Malaterra and William of Apulia.
The refinements of culture, be it Muslim, Byz-
antine or Latin, thus were not lost on the Norman warlords who established themselves in the south. Their reputation, however, has usually been quite 
the reverse of cultured, that is, crude and violent. 
Of Roger I, the ‘great count’ who subdued Sicily, an exemplary anecdote is recounted by the Arab 
sources in this respect: 
Baldwin, king of the Franks and kinsman of Roger the Frank who had conquered Sicily, 
sent word to Roger saying: ‘I have assembled ment, however, in fact points at unusual privilege and power. An illustration of this and of the liter-
ary sensibilities at court is the remarkable poem in 
Byzantine (that is more or less Classical Attic) Greek by an anonymous court official who fell from grace and was banished to Malta, begging 
George to reinstate him. Strikingly, the poem not 
only uses Classical Latin precedents, especially from Ovid, in its Greek phrasing, but actually 
engages in extended intertextuality with the  
Latin canon, thereby showing both that its author was educated amongst a Latin elite — probably 
southern Italian — and according to the high stand-
ard of literary culture in Norman circles, a standard

Tin canteen with a flattened spheri-cal shape, also known in literature as a pilgrim’s bottle. The bottle has 
a smooth surface, an oval profile, 
and a more or less cylindrical neck with screw thread for the cap.  On the shoulders are two eyes 
through which a leather or textile 
strap could be passed. The flask has a low foot consisting of a  
hollow ring with rectangular open-
ings on either side through which the strap was also passed. The cap is made of tin as well; it 
has a screw thread on the inside. 
The top has been modelled into a decorative grip consisting of three rings. There are traces of soldering 
where the foot is attached and 
along the sides of the bottle, show-ing that the two identical halves 
were soldered together lengthwise; 
then the foot was soldered on.  Comparison with similar bottles made of majolica allows us to  
date this one to the late fifteenth 
century, when the use of tin was becoming common. The flask is  in a good state of preservation,  although there are visible dents and slight alterations in the surface and the foot is damaged. Because 
it was on the sea floor for a long 
time, the flask was covered by  vegetation and limestone in several spots, sealing off the cap. During 
the restoration these incrustations 
were removed, as were the exo-skeletons on the tin (so-called tin 
cancer).  
To investigate the bottle’s contents the solid and liquid residues inside it were removed by enlarging the 
existing hole at the bottom. The 
value of the find because of its rar -
ity and historical-artistic character -
istics is further enhanced by the 
nature of its contents: laboratory 
analysis of the various substances has found micro-organisms specif-
ic to wine. The canteen was recov-

"139DREAMS OF HARMONY: MULTICULTURALISM AND NORMAN SICILYinvolvement in Sicilian matters was very gradual) 
nor Norman: like later British travellers (Norman 
Douglas, indeed), the Normans had gone native 
within a few decades.
After initial clashes with Rome, the Normans 
increasingly worked closely with the papacy  
and the Abbey of Montecassino from the last  
decades of the eleventh century onwards and thus won Sicily for the western church, with massive 
endowments of Benedictine monasteries on the 
island as a consequence, and hence the Latin i-
sation of the island. This process was indeed at-
tempted in the period, but it notoriously never 
fully materialised, at least according to the influen-tial analyses of Lampedusa in Il gattopardo (1958 , 
translated into English as The Leopard), where  
the prince of Salina warns the representative of United-Italy-to-be that so many, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans and Hohenstaufens included, 
hoped they could ‘integrate Sicily into the stream 
of history’ and ply it to their will, but in vain.
If Lampedusa is right, the tolerance and multi-
culturalism that we now admire in medieval Sicily 
may very well be a sign not of success, but of fail-
ure. The pretensions visible in Norman funerary monuments do indeed portend a much more 
openly ‘Latin’ and Roman profile than the one 
now available in standard history. When Roger I died in 1101  he had chosen as a sarcophagus a 
massive classical specimen from the third century 
AD, now in the National Museum in Naples. This 
choice represented a breach with Norman prac-tice, which consisted of the creation of ‘modern’ 
sepulchres, but strikingly conformed to papal 
practice from the later eleventh century onwards, where antique sarcophagi were first employed as 
an illustration of the imitatio imperii so dear to the 
Hildebrandine Reform. Eventually King Roger II 
would be interred in the cathedral of Palermo in imperial porphyry, distinctly reminiscent of Con-
stantinian monuments. Perhaps Norman rulers of 
Sicily most of all wanted to be seen as Latin Ro-man emperors in tandem with the Roman pontiff. 
If we honour them now as multiculturalists avant 
la lettre that may ironically be because they did not succeed in their effort.a great army and now I am on my way to 
you, to use your bases for my conquest of 
the African coast. Thus we shall become neighbours.’ Roger called together his com-
panions and consulted them: ‘This will be 
fine both for them and for us!’ they declared, ‘for by this means these lands will be con-verted to the Faith!’ At this, Roger raised 
one leg and farted loudly, swearing that this 
was of more use than their advice. 
Roger’s motivation for this resounding gesture, 
so it appears in the sequel, is that Frankish inter-
vention would only have spelled trouble and  
cost while necessitating him to break his word  
to his Arab allies. The historicity of the account may indeed be questionable  —  King Baldwin is 
evidently a conflation of two figures  —  , but it 
conserves the memory of some highly relevant aspects of Norman rule. The fart represents the reputation of the Normans as vulgar upstarts.  
Y et, paradoxically, the anecdote also encodes the 
Normans’ integration into Muslim culture, repre-senting them as setting store by their Arab friends more than by their former countrymen. Indeed, 
the ‘Norman invasion’ of Sicily was recently 
described as neither an invasion (since Norman GEORGE OF ANTIOCH AT THE

The site of Marausa, between Trapani and 
Marsala on Sicily’s west end, lies oppo -
site the Aegadian Islands and, like them, occupies a strategic geographical posi
-
tion, both from a military and a commercial point of view — it’s a perfect port of call between north
-
ern Africa and Italy. In 1999 the side of a ship from the late Roman period was discovered in the shallow waters off the Marausa beach. It lay about 2 m deep, 
 
covered in mud and sea grass. Following the  
discovery a first archaeological investigation was conducted in 2000. A narrow trench was dug 
 
at right angles to the axis of the ship, near the centre. The results showed that the ship was a merchantman, c.16 m long and c.8 m wide, built with the ‘shell-first’ technique. The subsequent campaigns of excavation and recovery came to a conclusion in 2011, when the timber parts were taken to a specialised laboratory. There they were 
cleaned, decontaminated, impregnated with 
modified carbohydrates, and dried in a non-con
-
tinuous vacuum. These innovative conservation treatments have brought out the characteristic colours of the timbers: larch for the hull and ash for the keel and ribs. Once the stabilisation of the fragments is completed, they will be reassembled in a reconstruction operation, so that the ship
-
wreck can be shown to the public. Since the ship went down so close to the shore, it is likely that the cargo was salvaged at once; in fact, few amphoras were found, the majority in a fragmented state. The ceramics found at the site of the shipwreck certainly belonged to it and can be dated between the end of the third and the fourth century AD; most of it seems to have been manufactured in northern Africa. The amphora 
fragments constituting most of the ceramics 
mainly belong to the types African II C.2, Keay 25.1, African II D, and Dressel 30; together they form the principal category of materials on which the date of the find context is based. The fact that some amphoras were lined with pitch while others were not shows the diversity 
 
of the foodstuffs they contained, such as oil,  
preserved fish, and wine; transport of dried fruit has been attested as well. In the area of the shipwreck other maritime archaeological finds have been made as well, dating from the Hellenistic era onward. They prove that this was a busy navigation route over 
 
a long period of time. Late Graeco-Italic ampho -
ras in particular are numerous, as are fragments of thin pottery dating from the first century BC 
 
to the first century AD. The finds also include Black-Gloss pottery (Campana B), amphora 
 
fragments of the types Dressel 1C and Dressel 2–4, and a few shards of Gallic terra sigillata with relief decoration from the first century AD. The concentration of archaeological materials in this area seems to be connected to the shape of the coast in Antiquity. There used to be a river

to what is now the river Birgi; its estuary was navi -

ancient harbour quays have been found, attesting to the existence of a river anchorage near coastal centres that have not yet been sufficiently re  -

by archaeological materials found during research at the surface and corresponding chronologically 
to those found in the sea opposite.

-
tion that around AD 300 a particular increase occurred in northern-African export of foodstuffs to Italy. Moreover, comparative analysis of the amphoras from the Marausa ship makes it 
 
possible to further restrict the research area regarding production locations; Professor Bonifay has reached the very plausible conclusion that they were manufactured at what is now Nabeul 
 
(Tunisia).Significantly, the amphoras produced at the Nabeul site show similarities to those from work
-
shops at the settlement of Sidi Aoun (Algeria) regarding their shapes, meant for preservation and transport of products such as oil. In the 
 
third and fourth centuries AD, oil was exported, in particular from the province of Byzacena (Tunisia), to other regions of the empire that 
 
had been hit by economic regression. The results from the study of amphora types has thus made it possible to reconstruct the route of the ship found at Marausa, from the African coast where the exported goods originated to the site of the shipwreck. However, we can’t deter

mine its final destination, so it is impossible to say with any certainty whether its cargo of African foodstuffs was meant for Sicilian centres or for other parts of the empire. ROMAN MERCHANT SHIPS

In most of the find contexts that have been

men from northern Africa, carriers of an ‘Islamic’ culture, its characteristics defined no further. The import amphoras dated between the tenth and twelfth centuries are practically absent from archaeological contexts found on western Sicily. Most of the objects on the island are occasional finds or were removed from their context. 
 
Specimens belonging to this period come from lucky underwater finds in the sea surrounding Mazara del Vallo on Sicily’s west coast and from the vaults of some Norman buildings at Palermo. This fact appears to contradict western Sicily’s position as a commercial hub in the Islamic Mediterranean as it emerges from contemporary 
written sources. 
Against this background appears the shipwreck that was discovered at about two nautical miles south of Favignana on the Aegadian Isles in 2000. The find was due to the work of what is now the Soprintendenza del Mare della Regione Siciliana and the cooperation of two local fisher

operation gave us a completer picture of the 
shipwreck: it was an oval heap, about 2.5 m high, 15 m long and 5 m wide, its sides sloping down to the sandy sea floor. The cargo corresponded perfectly to the ship’s contours and was completely intact; even the way the objects had been arranged by shape and size 
had been preserved. The cargo consisted of small 
amphoras, c.40 cm in height and sorted by type: the largest ones had been placed near the ship’s sides, the smaller ones near the area where tapering roof tiles were stacked, a systematic stowage in rows that is still in its original state.At the sides of the cargo traces can be seen of the ship’s hull, completely preserved under the sand. The amphoras of white-greenish clay are egg-shaped with a flat bottom, a thick rim, and ribbon-shaped handles with curls underneath. The surface is corrugated, as was customary 
 
in the Middle Ages. Some of the amphoras are thicker under the rim; there are also smaller 
 
ones with a four-lobed rim which served as jugs. Apart from the amphoras a large number of 
 
conical flat-bottomed bowls has been found.  
The area where the perfectly stacked roof tiles were found is concentrated and lies at about three-quarters of the ship toward the bow, taking up c.3 m of the ship’s length. Because of the great depth, the site can only be visited by

The Arabo-Norman shipwreck at Torre Faro

Sicily’s rich and culturally diverse past  
has long been the subject of historical 
analysis. One of its earliest and most 
influential interpreters is the now largely 
forgotten historian and antiquarian T ommaso Fazello. Born in 1498  in Sciacca near Agrigento, 
Fazello entered the Dominican convent in Paler - 
mo as a young man and steadily made a name for himself as an orator and teacher. Fazello was by no 
means a prolific scholar, but when he died in 1570  
he had become somewhat of a household name in 
Sicilian intellectual circles. His fame rested on a 
single work: the De Rebus Siculis Decades Duae, 
published in Palermo in 1558 . This extensive and 
exhaustive study is a historical and geographical analysis of Sicily, which earned its author lavish 
praise and made him the father of Sicilian history 
or ‘the Sicilian Livy’. In the first part of his book Fazello presents a topographical overview of Sicily 
and its cities, while the second part is dedicated to 
the long list of its inhabitants, settlers and rulers, from the primi habitatores (first inhabitants) to Emperor Charles V (ruled 1519 –1556 ).
This two-tiered approach was very much the 
product of Fazello’s life and work on the island. Although a Dominican friar, Fazello travelled 
extensively and — as he informs his readers in  
the preface of his book — crossed Sicily on foot  
at least four times to see with his own eyes what 
his ancient and medieval sources described. The 
combination of autopsy and bookish knowledge 
was fruitful and scholars nowadays still credit Fazello with the ‘discovery’ of multiple ancient monuments, albeit with various success. One such 
example is a monumental temple in Acragas  
(present-day Agrigento), also known as the temple of Concordia. In Fazello’s days it had been turned into a Christian church, only to be stripped of its 
later additions in the eighteenth century. Fazello Tommaso Fazello:

SICILY AND THE SEA  THE EARLY MODERN PERIOD
In 1535  Charles departed from Barcelona with a 
vast fleet to recover Tunis from the notorious 
Ottoman mercenary Hayreddin Barbarossa. After a 
successful expedition, the emperor set sail to Sicily and, having reached Palermo, receded to the cathedral, where at sunset — in the words of 
Fazello — ‘he three times swore the oath of the 
Sicilian kings to protect faithfully and with integ-rity the rights of the city and the kingdom.’ Fazel-
lo’s Sicily saw its rulers change, but its customs 
remain the same. correctly identified it as a Greek temple, but was mistaken as to its dedication, being misled by a 
local, but later Roman inscription that referred  
to it as sacred to Concordia.
In his approach, Fazello proved to be a typical 
sixteenth-century antiquarian and archaeologist. 
But De Rebus Siculis is more than a series of des- 
 criptions of Sicilian sites, towns and their inhabit-
ants. Fazello’s narrative is one of continuity 
through change and, consequently, his Sicily is  
a world populated by invaders and settlers, who  all came after each other in rapid succession. It 
was the sea that brought these new inhabitants to 
and from the capes of Sicily and, not surprisingly, Fazello opens his book with a careful considera-tion of the geographical importance of Sicily and 
its central position in the Mediterranean. At the 
end of the book we come full circle: the last chap-ter is dedicated to the reign of Charles V , Holy 
Roman emperor and king of Sicily, to whom 
Fazello had also dedicated the work. Y et only once did ‘El Dorado’ (‘the Golden One’) visit his island. TEMPLE OF CONCORDIA

Sicily, surrounded by the beating billow  
of the Mediterranean Sea, has witnessed 
the rise and fall of civilisations, and of 
powerful men and women too. Its name, 
as the Dutch novelist and traveller Louis Couperus (1863–1923 ) suggested, ‘rustles like a breath of 
poetry.’ Although Sicily may have been an inspira-
tion for poets and for novelists, its art history is 
even more fascinating. Couperus described the amalgamation of styles and art forms in Sicily in  
a very baroque manner, but it often becomes 
more interesting if it is not only about styles  and techniques, but rather about the creativity  
and ingenuity of individuals.
One such individual was the Sicilian master 
Antonello da Messina (c.1430 –1479 ), who plays  
an interesting part, not only within Sicilian art 
history, but also on a European stage. The found-ing father of art history, the Italian Giorgio Vasari 
(1511–1574 ), describes how Antonello travelled 
from Sicily to Naples to see a painting by Jan van 
Eyck (c.1390 –1441 ), executed in a technique that 
for him was completely new. As a binding 
medium Van Eyck had not used tempera, as the 
Italian painters were used to doing, but oil. Vasari tells us Antonello was impressed by this new  technique and travelled to Bruges, where he became an apprentice of Van Eyck. On his return to Italy, Antonello allegedly settled in Venice, 
where he disclosed Van Eyck’s secrets to the 
painter Domenico Veneziano, who in turn intro-duced this relatively new technique in Florence.
Van Eyck played a pivotal role in the develop-
ment and refinement of the oil painting tech-nique, and was thus credited by Vasari as its  inventor—albeit erroneously. Oil as a binding 
medium for pigments offered spectacular new 
opportunities, because of its slower drying process. For instance, it enables the artist to place thin, 
semi-transparent layers of paint over one another 
to enhance a more refined expression of details and textures. Furthermore, the viewer has a 
stronger sensation of space and depth because  
of the layered translucent surface. The pasty  composition of the paint makes it possible to let 
the brushstroke dissolve completely, or on the 
contrary (as it was done in later times) to show the plasticity of the paint. 
Intriguingly, Antonello probably did not study 
with Jan van Eyck—he was about eleven years old when Van Eyck died, and furthermore there is no documentary evidence of it. He actually may have     Sicily’s Role in

seen Van Eyck’s Lomellini Triptych (now lost),  
which was presumably brought to Naples in 1444 . 
It may also have been other Netherlandish works 
belonging to Alfonso V of Aragon (ruled 1416 –
1458), king of Sicily and patron of Niccolò Colan-
tonio, who is thought to have been Antonello’s 
master and whose work shows Netherlandish 
influences as well.
Apart from Antonello’s mastery of the tech-
nique of oil painting, his works demonstrate a keen interest in refined detail. His portraits are bust-length figures seen frontally or slightly in 
three-quarter view against a dark background.  
It should be emphasised that he adopted a Ne -therlandish portrait model here, while most previ-ous Italian painters applied the medal-style por-trait, in which idealised sitters were presented in 
strict profile. John Pope-Hennessy described 
Antonello as ‘the first Italian painter for whom the individual portrait was an art form in its own 
right.’ 
For instance, when looking at Antonello’s 
breath-taking Virgin Annunciate, now in Palermo, the viewer encounters the Virgin Mary, visualised 
frontally as described above, at the very moment 
the angel Gabriel approaches her to announce  
her role within the divine plan. The viewer or worshipper approaches her and, taking the angel’s place as it were, utters the first words of the rosary prayer: ‘Ave Maria gratia plena.’ She leaves the 
viewer in uncertainty about her answer and moves 
her hand to protect her from the bright light that enters the room. Since we, as viewers, become 
part of the scene, Antonello’s visualisation of the 
subject is both simple and complex in a psycho-logical sense, and superior to usual representations (often in profile) of the scene. It is without any 
doubt a work for private devotion.
Apart from northern influences, Antonello’s 
works show a thorough knowledge of linear  perspective and his modelling of figures demon-
strate an anatomical understanding that Jan van Eyck and his countrymen were not capable of. 
These were typical Italian achievements at the 
time. Some art historians have gone so far as to imagine a meeting in Milan between Antonello and Petrus Christus, Jan van Eyck’s most talented 
pupil, to explain the existence of a cultural transfer 
of ideas: Petrus Christus, the first Netherlandish painter to learn linear perspective, and Antonello, 
the first Italian to master Eyckian oil painting. 
However this may be, Antonello uses a ‘Flemish 
grammar within an Italian syntax’, to quote art 
historian Bernard Aikema. Working for the  most of his career in what was perceived to be  
a cultural periphery, Messina, he combined 
achievements of both Italian and northern paint-ing schools in a truly fascinating way. But, as Keith 
Christiansen puts it: ‘to artists working in a sea-
port, long-distance travel did not present the same difficulties it did to the more land-locked, and the 
question facing anyone trying to “explain” the 
amazing trajectory of Antonello’s career is how

I can only add to this that not only artists  
travelled, but art works and ideas travelled too.
Between 1460  and 1465 , Antonello is  
mentioned in several documents, suggesting his  
presence in Messina in those years. But between 
1465 and 1471 , a gap in the source material makes 
it plausible he spent these years travelling or  
somewhere on the mainland. One of Antonello’s 
documented voyages resulted in his sojourn in 
Venice in 1475 –76. It is often suggested he  
there exchanged ideas with Giovanni Bellini 
(1430 –1516 ), also known for experimenting with 
oil paint and becoming an accomplished and renowned master in this medium. Was it perhaps 
Antonello who introduced him to it?
T echnical research shows that neither Antonello 
nor Bellini worked according to the strict proce-dures of Van Eyck’s studio. But when scrutinising their works in detail, we can see that the painstak-
ing precision of Van Eyck’s paintings, which is ap- 
parent in details such as painted pages of books, props or tiled floors, is missing in Antonello’s work. When creating shadows in painted draper-
ies, Antonello did not make use of the time- 
consuming glazing technique of thin layers of semi-transparent paint, but simply mixed colours 
with whites and blacks. He thus imitated the ma- 
 nie ra fiamminga in an inventive way, combining it 
with the achievements of the Italian masters. This 
was his gift to art: Antonello combined contrasting 
approaches, two philosophies of observation and 
visualisation that appear to be diametrically op-  posed with each other, brought together in perfect 
synergy, thus transcending every earlier individual 
effort. Antonello’s gift in turn was presented to him by the bustling port of Messina, full of people, goods and ideas, and by the restless waves of the 
Mediterranean Sea."
"156
SICILY AND THE SEA  THE EARLY MODERN PERIODOne of the most suggestive spots on  
Sicily’s south coast is the final resting-
place of perhaps the greatest author the 
island has borne, Luigi Pirandello, 
marked by a rock on a plateau with a view of  the Greek temples near Agrigento and the sea 
stretching to Africa. This monumental yet simple 
grave, flanked by a pine tree, suggests movement as well as standstill with the weight of the stone and 
the lines of sight linking it to history through the 
ancient remains and to the restless life associated with the sea. Lying near the plateau’s edge, the 
grave appears to float over the ground on which  
it weighs so heavily and to move toward the sky, the sea, and the characteristic silhouette of the  Valley of the T emples. 
Turning around toward the island from here, 
one soon reaches a simple house, striking because of its loneliness in the rough landscape. Here, just 
a few hundred metres from where he is buried, 
Pirandello was born in a house which can hardly be said to fire the imagination, but over the last decades has become one of the island’s favourite 
monuments nonetheless. Visitors come here to 
enjoy the special location and the view, but also  to ponder on an author whose work says so much 
about Sicily, about appearance and essence, about 
attachment to the past and longing for a different world. About the island’s connection with the sea. 
Y et it is little more than a coincidence that 
Pirandello was born and buried here, in a place whose name appears to speak volumes: Kaos. When his mother, Caterina Ricci-Gramito, was nearing the end of her second pregnancy in June 
1867, her place of birth and residence, Agrigento, 
was hit by a cholera epidemic. She decided to seek 
the isolation of the family’s country cottage in the remote hamlet Càvusi (Kaos). On 28 June she 
gave birth to a son there, Luigi, who during the 
rest of his life would hardly ever stay in the cot-tage again. Quite the contrary: partly due to cir-
cumstances, but definitely not against his will, he 
was to lead an increasingly nomadic existence, certainly from 1915  when he gained international 
fame and acknowledgement as the author of re  vo-
lutionary plays (Così è se vi pare, Sei personaggi in 
cerca d’autore, Enrico IV: Right You Are If You Think So, Six Characters Looking For A Writer, Henry IV). 
As a consequence Pirandello was very much an 
author who was not tied to any place when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 
1934. An author moreover whose work focuses on 
disorientation, viewed particularly in an emotional 
and psychological dimension. 
He used his modest apartment on the Via Bosio 
in Rome only sporadically, in the short breaks between frequent travels taking him all over the world with his theatre company. More than this 
pied-à-terre, the ocean steamers taking him to 
South and North America had become his home. After his rather unexpected death on 10  Decem-
ber 1936  there consequently remained little in  
the spartan apartment that could be regarded as characteristic of Pirandello’s life and work.   Pirandello’s House:

and present — he wanted to recognise something 
of his fascination for the complicated, interesting, 
but often tough game of essence and appearance. 
It would take several decades, however, before 
anything was done with this remarkable fascina-
tion in the place itself and Pirandello’s last will was 
realised. Initially his ashes were kept in a grave on the Roman cemetery Campo Verano. Only after 
ten years, in 1946, the urn — a beautiful Greek 
vase — was transported to Sicily and placed in 
Agrigento’s Museo Civico. After Pirandello’s birth house had been declared a national monument  
(in 1949 ) and bought by the region (in 1952 ), the 
urn could be brought here, in 1956 . Another five 
years later, on 10  December 1961 , the ashes were 
finally taken from the urn and deposited where Pirandello wanted them: under a rock on the cot-tage grounds, next to a solitary pine tree and with 
a view of the Valley of the T emples and the sea.
The cottage itself was only renovated half a 
century after the purchase by the regional author-
ities, who then turned it into a museum for the 
author. This happened after a whirlwind had 
severely damaged the house in 1997  and felled  
the pine tree guarding the grave. It was the 
destruction of the monument that led to the 
acknowledgement of its value, although that acknowledgement was also fostered, both locally and internationally, by a widely acclaimed film in 
which its location plays an important and perhaps 
all-defining part. In Kaos, the motion picture  the Taviani brothers made in 1984, based on five 
stories by Pirandello, the ground where the author 
was born and lies buried provides an all-encom-passing frame — in a visionary rather than a mate-
rial sense. The timeless dimension where primeval forces act at will that this film so vividly depicts is an homage to Pirandello and his work, devoted to the deepest human impulses. But it is just as much 
an ode to a place where this becomes tangible, as 
Pirandello experienced it, too: the simple farmer’s home, a lone outpost in an impressive landscape 
where past and present touch, as the island 
touches the sea. Although a centre for theatre studies was later cre-ated here which certainly cherished the austere original inventory, the establishment of a museum 
for the author was to take a long time. 
That was exactly as Pirandello had intended. 
He had stated in his will that his memorial service 
was to be held without much ado and that his 
body was to be cremated. The ashes were to be 
scattered, so that absolutely nothing would remain of him. Y et Pirandello realised that his longing for 
anonymity and loss of materiality was hard to  
reconcile with his status as a cultural icon, even though he had become the standard bearer of a modern nomadic existence in which boundaries 
between appearance and essence are fluid. He 
therefore added that if his ashes could not be  scattered, they had to be put in an ancient urn, 
which then was to be kept, covered by a rock,  
at the place of his birth near Agrigento. And so it happened in the end.
At the time of Pirandello’s passing in 1936  the 
cottage and its grounds no longer belonged to  the family, which had met with great financial  difficulties over time. Precisely because of his 
nomadic life, the author himself had rejected the 
possibility to buy back the house were he was born. Y et it was dear to him unlike any other, as  
is clear from his last will. A remarkable choice  
for a writer intent on laying bare the essential characteristics hidden behind a façade of outward appearances often determined materially. Unless

Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter,  
who was born in 1607  in Vlissingen 
(Flushing) in the province of Zeeland in the Dutch Republic, is today by far 
the most famous naval hero of the seventeenth century in the Netherlands. He distinguished 
himself in fifty-five battles, of which fifteen were 
major sea battles, nine of them fought under his command. His 400th birthday was lavishly com-
memorated in 2007  with books, lectures and  
exhibitions. A film on his life premiered in the 
Netherlands in January 2015 .The most important sea battles under the com-
mand of Admiral De Ruyter were fought during the three Anglo-Dutch Wars in the third quarter of the seventeenth century. In the Third Anglo-
Dutch War, between 1672 and 1674 , De Ruyter’s 
fleet battled a strong combined Anglo-French 
fleet. The English and the French had allied forces during this war and struggled against the Dutch  
as their common enemy at sea. A plan to land mil-
itary forces for an invasion on the west coast of the Dutch Republic had to be aborted after De 
Ruyter’s fleet successfully fought the combined 
Anglo-French fleet during the Battle of T exel on August 21 , 1673 . Soon after this disappointment 
the English decided to make peace. The French however decided to continue the war, which they fought on land and at sea.
After both De Ruyter and his colleague  
Cornelis Tromp had failed to inflict major losses on the French in the West Indies and on the west coast of France respectively, the Mediterranean 
became the principal theatre of naval operations. 
This sea was where most of the French, Dutch and Spanish naval forces, the last being allies of the Dutch, were to be found. A revolt at Messina, 
which was Spanish territory at the time, was the 
cause. With the Messinese revolting against King Philip IV of Spain (ruled 1621 –1665 ), the French 
king Louis XIV (ruled 1643 –1715 ) decided to send 
help. The French fleet defeated the Spanish in the beginning of 1675  and threatened to conquer the 
whole of Sicily. The king of Spain thereupon     Michiel de Ruyter

"159MICHIEL DE RUYTER IN SICILIAN WATERSSicily. He found only one Spanish warship and 
heard that their fleet was expected there sooner or 
later.
In the meantime, De Ruyter received informa-
tion that a large French fleet of twenty ships 
under Admiral Abraham Duquesne and a strong 
French squadron of ten ships under Rear Admiral 
Guillaume d’Alméras were expected to join forces off Messina to attack the city. Having decided that 
it would be foolish to wait until the enemy had 
united his forces, he sailed immediately in search of Duquesne with his fleet, now consisting of 
nineteen frigates. On 8 January 1676  he finally 
met with Duquesne’s fleet near the island of 
Stromboli—it outgunned the Dutch squadron  by far and was much better manned. A tough sea 
battle ensued, lasting from the early morning until 
dark. De Ruyter did a tremendous job leading his ships into battle: the French lost 400 men in all; 
the Dutch had only 80  dead to mourn. But no 
victory was won on either side. 
In the days after the battle nine Spanish  
warships joined De Ruyter’s squadron, but Duquesne’s fleet was united with the squadron  
of D’Alméras off Messina. De Ruyter realised it would be unwise to challenge this French fleet 
and decided to return home because he had no 
orders to stay in the Mediterranean any longer. However, on his way back he received a letter from his superiors, who obliged him to return  
to Sicily without any promise of substantial  
reinforcements. Off Naples his diplomatic skills helped him to free twenty-six Hungarian Protes-
tant clergymen who were working as slaves on 
Spanish galleys—this was no mean feat and is commemorated in Hungary up to this day.
In February, 1676  De Ruyter fitted out his 
ships as best as he could for another battle against the French. He was especially worried about the bad state of the Spanish men-of-war, but was  
unable to do anything about it. In March the 
Dutch and Spanish ships formed a combined fleet, ready to attack the French. The recapture of Mes-
sina was their goal, but when news arrived that an 
attack by Spanish land forces on this city had failed, De Ruyter changed plans. He now pre-ferred to battle the French fleet on the open sea.  
A victory would mean that Messina would have decided to ask the Dutch Republic for naval  
support.
By 1675  De Ruyter had become an old and 
obese man because of a kidney or bladder stone, which often kept him bedridden. He was not  
the strong man he used to be and under normal 
circumstances not the ideal man to appoint com-mander of a relatively small squadron of the fleet 
bound for a difficult mission in the Mediterra-
nean. A younger and less prominent naval officer would have been a much more obvious choice. But the Dutch authorities turned to De Ruyter 
and he was not the man to reject such an appoint-
ment. Although often staying home because of his illness he was adamant that he would make the 
journey, even if he had to be carried to his ship.
All the ships of his squadron were equipped 
badly because the Dutch admiralties were in  
difficult financial circumstances. De Ruyter’s own 
man-of-war, the Zeven Provinciën (Seven Provinces), 
was not ready for a long trip and he was forced to hoist his flag on another ship, the smaller and less 
robust Eendracht (Concord). The officers who 
accompanied De Ruyter during this voyage were all relatively unknown to him, because they were 
much younger. His trusted old colleagues had 
fallen in naval battles in the years before or had gone out of service. With only eighteen men- of-war and a number of smaller ships De Ruyter 
set sail on 8 August 1675. When he left he bade his

On open sea De Ruyter soon concluded that  
a large part of the ropes, wood and sails of his  flagship and of most of the other vessels was of bad quality. However he was not taken aback by 
this and continued his journey with the utmost 
resilience until his squadron arrived in the Medi-terranean. As ordered he looked for the Spanish 
fleet in a number of Spanish harbours, but he was 
unable to find it. During his search he received a message that one part of their fleet was in the har-bour of Cagliari in Sardinia. The other part would 
sail from Naples to Palermo and unite with all the 
other ships to realise their goal, recapturing Mes-sina. De Ruyter sailed to Cagliari but could not 
find any Spanish ships there. T owards the end of

for a convoy from T oulon with all sorts of provi-sions on board.
On Sunday 22 April 1676 the two enemy 
squadrons met just off Augusta (north of Syra-cuse), but the encounter is generally remembered as the Battle of Etna. The combined Dutch and 
Spanish fleet and that of France faced off on a sea

came from a stingray species that only occurs  in South America: a telling example of long-

A cultural historian’s reflections on the 
place of the sea in the discourse on 
modern Sicily would be incomplete 
without a little histoire-bataille. It starts  
on 11  May 1860 , when the adventurer Giuseppe 
Garibaldi (1807 –1882 ) and about 1,000  volunteers 
landed near Marsala on the island’s west coast.  The ‘Redshirts’ had set out from Quarto near Genoa on 5 May in two captured steamships. 
Once on Sicily, Garibaldi took the island by storm 
‘in the name of King Vittorio Emanuele II and Italy’, defeating the troops of the Bourbon rulers 
of Naples. After a decisive battle at Milazzo on 20 
July he crossed to the mainland again, followed by an ever-growing army. Following a plebiscite in October 1860 , Sicily became part of the kingdom 
Sardinia-Piemonte, which on 17  March 1861   
officially became the new kingdom of Italy.
T o the Risorgimento’s political visionaries, 
both Sicily and the sea were inseparably con-nected to the envisioned Italy. Giuseppe Mazzini (1805 –1872 ), for instance, had no doubt that God 
had granted the Italians ‘the most clearly defined 
country in Europe’, thanks to the Alps forming a 
natural crown on the peninsula as well as to mare nostrum, the Mediterranean which like a shining 
coat of armour encloses Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica 
and the smaller islands and makes them inalienable parts of the nation. At the same time, in the federal vision Mazzini initially shared with the philoso-
pher Carlo Cattaneo, the sea gave Sicily the 
advantage of relative isolation. In any case the  territorial unity was undisputed, as is clear from 
the saying that the nation reached ‘from the Alps 
to Lilybaeum’ (present-day Marsala).
This reference to the ancient Carthaginian city 
betrays an ambiguous view of Sicily’s turbulent past, 
in which the sea played such a central role. Nine-
teenth-century writers such as Cesare Balbo and Vincenzo Gioberti concluded that due to its loca-
tion the island was more exposed to dangers from 
outside than any other part of Italy. Because of the successive confrontations with Phoenicians, Greeks, 
Arabs, Normans and the houses of Anjou, Aragon 
and Bourbon, a spirit of resistance had taken hold on the island that could be an inspiration for the national resurgence. Especially the story of the 
Sicilian Vespers, a revolt of the people against King 
Charles of Anjou in 1282, was to play that part, thanks to the paintings by Francesco Hayez and 
Giuseppe Verdi’s opera (1855 ), among others.
At the same time Gioberti acknowledged that 
Sicily owed its prosperity to those external influ-
ences. The grain that the goddess Ceres first sowed 
there came from the Orient; Theocritus’ bucolic 
poetry (third century BC) was indebted to a He-  
brew tradition; scientists such as Archimedes (see 
p. 65) and Empedocles (p. 43) were ‘Greek’ Sicili-
ans; Italian literature had developed at the court of 
Frederick II (1220–1250 ), a descendant of Norman 
and Swabian princes. Y et the origins of Sicilian 
civilisation were unmistakably ‘Italian’. That 
ancient Italian civilisation was not only superior to the other Mediterranean cultures, but older as The Risorgimento   
    and the SeaASKER PELGROM

"163THE RISORGIMENTO AND THE SEA
well. Authors such as Gioberti, Vincenzo Cuoco, 
Giuseppe Micali and Angelo Mazzoldi offered a 
bizarre explanation for this: Italy was to be identi-
fied with the Greek philosopher Plato’s Atlantis, which c.2000  BC had been struck by a natural 
disaster that separated Sicily from the mainland. Italians had fled in large numbers, spreading their civilisation; as their Phoenician and Greek 
descendants returned to southern Italy many cen-
turies later, the memory of their country of origin had faded. 
This and other patriotic visions of history were 
replaced by the living myth of Garibaldi in 1860 . 
His triumphal procession through Sicily awakened 
associations with the past and thus with the sea, 
but they definitely were not all positive. Garibaldi and his men were ‘pirates’, ‘buccaneers’, ‘barbarians of the modern age’, and ‘Saracens of the revolu-
tionary idea’. On the other hand, he was presented 
as a ‘brother’ of Palermo’s patron saint Santa Rosa-lia, who had allegedly made him invulnerable. His offensive against the Bourbon dynasty was often 
compared to the Sicilian Vespers of the Middle 
Ages. Nor was there a lack of parallels from Antiq-uity and mythology: Garibaldi was a modern 
Cincinnatus, Leonidas or Perseus, a character from 
Plutarch’s Lives, or a hero bringing Homer’s verse to life. He was often likened to Odysseus, who was stranded on the same Sicilian shores. Around 1900  
this image still held an appeal, witness the poetry of Gabriele d’Annunzio and Giovanni Pascoli. 
Pascoli’s poems also draw a parallel with ano-
ther famous seafarer: Christopher Columbus. This reference to the New World was not isolated either, but fitted into a tradition of romantic ad- 
miration for discoverers and seafarers, especially 
the Italians among them (Columbus, Giovanni  da Verazzano, Amerigo Vespucci). That admiration 
came with the idea of Italy as a seafaring nation, 
which from the end of the eighteenth century  had sprung up in many allegoric pictures. 
A less monumental, but no less important  
tradition was the romantic topos of the smuggler or pirate, a marginal figure roaming the shores  and islands of the Mediterranean who didn’t care 
about boundaries or conventions and symbolised 
the love of freedom. George Lord Byron (The Corsair, 1814 ) was the father of this tradition, 
which found an enthusiastic following in Italy, e.g. 
in Vincenzo Bellini’s opera Il pirata (1827).  
Garibaldi’s romanticised life offered many links  to these various maritime motifs: not only had  
he travelled the Mediterranean as a sailor for years, 
but he had also first established his reputation as  LANDING OF THE THOUSAND  
AT MARSALA 
On 11 May 1860  
Giuseppe Garibaldi and  i Mille — the thousand (or so) volunteer patriots who 
formed the core of his 
fighting force — landed at the port of Marsala in  western Sicily and took the 
town without a shot being 
fired. This was a key mo-ment in the Risorgimento. 
Garibaldi’s subsequent 
march through Sicily and up to Naples eventually  led to the Unification of  
Italy and the creation of  
the modern Italian nation.  The British warships  Intrepid and Argus protect-

and in reports on rural Sicily from a bourgeois 
magazine such as L’illustrazione Italiana. This atten-
tion for the picturesque however did not hamper 
an explicitly negative judgement. Especially after 1870, representation and policy were determined by a range of stereotype characteristics ascribed to 
southern Italians and to Sicilians in particular:  
mafiosità, violence, a pathological kind of individu-
alism, superstition, effeminacy, illiteracy, corruption, 
lethargy, and a lack of social hygiene, to name just a 
few. In science and policy these stereotypes were often founded on social-Darwinist racial theories.
In the national discourse on Sicily after the 
Unification two tendencies stand out, roughly speaking. Firstly, the distance between the island and the mainland was growing steadily. ‘Morbid’ 
Sicily was increasingly viewed as a greater threat 
to ‘modern’ Italy than the rest of the south. Sec-ondly, representation of the island was character-
ised by a ‘denial of the sea’: the Sicily of this  
‘Orientalist’ discourse was almost exclusively an inland one of shepherds, bandits and farmers. This inward-oriented Sicily appeared to be standing 
still, untouched by external influence. It was an 
‘island’ of rustic chivalry but also of revenge and lawlessness, where natural passions ruled and all 
social responsibility was lacking. 
Even today this stereotype image is deeply 
rooted in the public discourse, in movie pictures, 
literature, advertising, tourist brochures, and in poli-
tics. Nor has the Sicilian self-image proved immune 
to it. On the other hand, the island has strongly resisted interference by the Italian nation since 
1860. The resulting ambiguous view that Sicily 
takes on the Risorgimento is well illustrated by the 
fact that all attempts to realise a monument for 
Garibaldi and the Thousand have come to nothing. 
The revulsion against the Italian nation in some cases leads to the blinding thought that all problems on the island were caused by external interference. 
If we are to believe Sicily’s former governor Raf-
faele Lombardo (2008), the island’s misery did not start with the Unification: ‘The first one to invade 
Sicily was not Garibaldi, but Odysseus. And the first 
of a long list of authors who have humiliated the Sicilians was Homer. [...] That was the start of the looting of my island, which is too rich not to 
attract robbers.’ As if the sea itself had brought all 
Sicily’s misfortunes upon it over the millennia.a guerrillero in South America — hence his epithet 
‘Hero of the T wo Worlds’. 
Strikingly, the comparison to Columbus was 
not only related to the New World, but to ancient 
Sicily as well. The image had already been con-
jured up during the Sicilian expedition, e.g. in the choice of name for the new journal Il mondo nuovo (The New World) which saw the light at Palermo 
in June 1860 , or in the lithography of Garibaldi’s 
landing at Marsala that appeared in September 
1860. Superficially, this picture fits the traditional 
imagery of Sicily’s open relation with the sea, but on closer inspection it heralds a new view that turned this relation inside out. In the picture it is the modern European Garibaldi who brings  
civilisation to the exotic islanders. 
This dualistic, paternalist imagery was to give 
rise, particularly after 1861 , to what has been called 
‘Orientalism within one country’: in the process of 
‘creating’ the new Italians, southern Italy was increasingly presented as ‘the other’, the counter-
image of the new nation. In this process, Sicily 
served as ‘the south of the south’, a place where  
the meridional character manifested itself enlarged and which thus was overly Italian and un-Italian 
(‘African’) at the same time. This idea did have 
precedents in European travel literature, but in Italy it acquired a national-political urgency from 1860  
onward, when the thought took hold that the north had to protect the south from itself. The  
Unification admittedly also generated attention for ‘picturesque’ Sicilian folk culture, as expressed in

E. A. FREEMAN AND THE HISTORY OF SICILY FROM THE 
EARLIEST TIMES  
‘In the view of universal history, the island of  
Sicily, the greatest of Mediterranean islands,  had a special calling laid upon it by its geo-graphical position.’ Thus the Oxford historian 
Edward A. Freeman (1823–1892) begins his 
four-volume history of Sicily (1891–1894): 2500 pages covering the Phoenician and Greek set-
tlers and events up to the death of Agathocles of 
Syracuse in the third century BC. Volume 4 was published posthumously by Freeman’s son-in-law, the famous archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans, with whom he had often visited Sicily. Freeman’s major work until then had been The History  of the Norman Conquest of England (1870–
1876), also in four volumes. The affinity he saw 
between the Norman conquest of England and the Norman kingdom on Sicily prompted him  to write his Sicilian history. With it he tried to 
construct unity in European history, with Rome 
at its heart. An important question to Freeman was whether Sicily belonged to African or Euro-pean territory; the answer would have been pro-vided by Roman rule. Because of his death at the age of sixty-eight, Freeman never got to the Roman period, much less the Normans. His grave, with an inscription by Sir Arthur Evans, is 
in Alicante in Spain, where he died on one of his 
travels.  Although outdated, The History of Sicily is still eminently readable, very well-documented with 
primary sources, and lavishly illustrated with  
exquisite maps.  Diederik BurgersdijkCAVALLERIA RUSTICANA Like the international

ter — the lives of the poor, 
for instance — that had not generally been seen as  
a fit subject for literature.

Since 1992 (when the wreck was discov -
ered) a team of professional archaeolo -
gists, specialising in underwater film and 
photography, and aficionados has been 
working on the recovery, study, preservation and restoration of the numerous and sometimes 
 
prestigious objects found on the sea floor off  
Sciacca in western Sicily. The scientific explora -
tion of natural reality, ‘which to us becomes an aesthetic object’ (R. Assunto), in the case of 
 
cultural heritage takes the sunken objects out of their metahistorical reality; brought back ashore, they are finally given back to history and become part of the everyday past. The action of finding the objects itself and of studying the finds, dated to the modern period without a doubt, has been enriched with the results of archive research that made it possible to analyse that which was producing a cultural event here and now. Based on the metal objects and the few pieces 
 
of pottery found at the site and on the archive documents, it is assumed that the shipwreck is that of a big merchantman that foundered off the Sicilian coast in 1581. However, the documented presence of the shipowner on board, the lack of interest on the heirs’ part in making any attempt to recover the ship’s cargo or equipment, and the 
presence of a number of cannons have raised 
doubts as to the real scope and the reasons underlying the presence of what the ship was transporting. The presence of some remains of the ship’s structure, which are still on the sea floor, gives us reason to hope that some day we will be able to open a special exhibition that will show the visitor not only what has been found so far — bronze 
and iron cannons, stone cannon balls, iron tongs, balls of lead, fragments of the ship’s bell, nails, rolls of lead for small reparations on sea, scraps 
of everyday objects and dishes — but also a 
 
hypothetical reconstruction of the ship, its char -
acteristics, the equipment from the shipyard,  
and the organisation of the cargo. The sailing

wrecked per fortuna di mare, by the sea’s fortune 
(the title of a study of the ship, published by the Soprintendenza del Mare di Palermo in 2012). The ship’s original name was San Juan, after 
 
the name saint of the owner, Captain Juan de Porto from the Spanish city of San Sebastian. He and part of the crew died in the port of La Spezia in 1579, possibly of the plague. The ship was then bought in 1580 by the Genoese shipowners Tomaso and Domenico Parissone; from then on 
 
it was called the Parissona Grossa in commercial acts, to distinguish it from a smaller ship. In the same year, the Parissones are charged with the transport of grain from Sciacca to Palermo by the viceroy of Sicily, Marcantonio Colonna. The oper

ation is conducted under Domenico’s command, but the voyage of summer 1581 is brutally bro

ken off by the shipwreck at Sciacca. It probably happened while the ship was awaiting a cargo of wheat with its loading hatches open and thus in a position of disadvantage. The recovery of more parts of the big ship and its equipment could — depending on their number 
and state of conservation — be the beginning of 
an ambitious project to reconstruct the entire vessel for exhibition, following the successful example (with some modifications) of the Gustav Vasa, the seventeenth-century ship that has its own museum on the island of Djurgården in Stockholm. 
Underwater research was started by the Sezione 
di Sciacca dei Gruppi Archeologici d’Italia, led by Calogero Santangelo, and has been conducted by the Soprintendenza del Mare since 2004, with the support of the same Sezione. Combined with the archive research by Renato Gianni Ridella, it has provided us with information on the origins 
 
of the ship, its route, its cargo, the origins of the implements for daily use, the ship’s age, and finally the decisions that led the Parissona Grossa to the place where it went down. The artillery cargo consisted of thirteen bronze and sixteen iron pieces. Of these, the following bronze cannons have been found: a demi-
 
culverin bastard (France, 1546–1547?), calibre  
108 mm; a heavy falcon with spirals on the barrel (France, 1537?), calibre 75 mm; a falcon (Italy, 1555–1560), calibre 70 mm; an esmeril for stone shot (Italy, 1555–1560), calibre 90 mm; a heavy dodecagonal falcon (France, 1537), calibre 72 mm; a cannon for stone shot (Italy, 1570–1575), calibre 145 mm. The two iron pieces that have 
been found are breech-loading esmerils for lead 
shot (Spain, mid-sixteenth century?), calibre 50 mm. All the cannons have been recovered and preserved, including restoration of the bronze by Riccardo Mancinelli. The majority of the recovered objects is now kept at Sciacca, in the building of the former Colonia Marina near the location of the shipwreck, and on display (particularly the bronze cannons) in the courtyard of Sciacca’s prestigious former

‘To have seen Italy without having seen 
Sicily is not to have seen Italy at all,  
for in Sicily is the clue to everything.’   
          Goethe
Goethe’s famous words from the Italian Journey, 
an account of his travels through Italy and Sicily in 1787, reveal the German writer’s wonder at the richness of the island’s cultural heritage. The 
stream of diverse peoples who traded with, settled 
on, and ruled over Sicily left lasting marks on its landscape as well as on the language, food, customs 
and spirit of the island. The striking Greek temples 
at Agrigento and Selinunte are among the best- preserved in the Mediterranean. Roman stone 
theatres at Taormina and Segesta still host dramatic 
performances today. At Syracuse, the fifth-century BC temple of Athena forms the structure of a 
cathedral that was constructed in the Byzantine 
period, briefly housed a mosque, and was given  a Baroque façade at the end of the seventeenth century. The famed ancient temple of Venus that 
crowned the dramatic mountain of Erice lies under a Norman castle. The fabric of Sicily is  
a palimpsest of cultures, testament to the Phoeni-
cian, Greek, Roman, Vandal, Goth, Byzantine, 
Arab, and Norman colonists and invaders. Peeling back these layers, focus has increased on Sicilian prehistory and the early inhabitants — the Elymi-
ans, Sicans and Sicels. 
Alongside this abundance of archaeological 
remains, Sicily possesses areas of great natural 
beauty and environmental importance. In 1972 , 
UNESCO (the United Nations Education,  
Scientific and Cultural Organisation) adopted  
the World Heritage Convention, a document  
that defined heritage as natural as well as cultural,  connecting the conservation of areas of scenic  
and geological significance to the preservation  
of man-made monuments and historic sites. Since then 1007  sites worldwide have been placed on 
the World Heritage List. Italy has more than any other member state with fifty-one entries, seven of which are located on Sicily: the Aeolian islands and Mount Etna because of their importance for  
volcanology and geology, the archaeological area Uncovering,

Syracuse archaeological museum. Born in Genoa, 
Luigi Bernabò Brea (1910 –1999 ) came to Sicily in 
his thirties. As archaeological superintendent of 
eastern Sicily he oversaw significant work in the area, devoting his final decades to vases and  
terracottas recovered from Lipari and the other 
Aeolian Islands. Vincenzo Tusa (1920–2009) focused his boundless energies on western Sicily; 
as archaeological superintendent of the region he 
combined championing the Phoenician and  Elymian presence on the island with caring for 
the Greek remains. Significantly, all these great 
individuals shared a fierce commitment to site preservation and fostering the collections (not to mention raising the profile) of Sicilian museums, 
several of which bear their names today, as well  
as to careful fieldwork and academic publication.
The interest and influence of foreign scholars 
and excavators in Sicily over the past centuries  has also been substantial, contributing both intel-lectually and financially. The Sicilian-born English merchant Joseph ‘Pip’ Whitaker (1850 –1936 ) 
amassed great wealth taking over his family’s busi-ness interests, including the distribution of Marsala wine. Settled in western Sicily, Whitaker devel-
oped a passion for archaeology. In 1902  he pur-
chased the island of Mozia off Marsala on the 
north-west point in order to conduct his own excavations there and brought to light the Punic 
settlement. He established the Museo Whitaker  
on Mozia to house the archaeological finds from the site and ultimately the Fondazione Whitaker 
was created. The site continued to be explored, 
and the discovery there in 1979  of the extraordi-
nary marble statue known as the Motya Y outh 
radically challenged our vision of ancient sculp-
ture and our understanding of art on Sicily. Not far from Mozia, the pioneering English maritime archaeologist Honor Frost (1917 –2010 ) uncovered 
the remains of a Punic ship at Marsala in 1971 . 
Having studied art at the Ruskin School in Oxford and worked as a ballet designer, Frost  
discovered a passion for diving and became a  
driving force behind the development and profes-sionalisation of the field of maritime archaeology. 
One of the longest-running excavations on the 
island takes place at the site of ancient Morgantina in central Sicily. It was initiated in 1955  by Prince-of Agrigento with its incredible Doric temples, the Villa Romana del Casale at Piazza Armerina 
housing spectacular mosaics, historic Syracuse,  
the Arabo-Norman monuments of Palermo, Cefalù and Monreale, and the eight towns of  the Val di Noto renowned for their remarkable 
Late-Baroque architecture and town planning. 
At the time of Goethe’s visit in the late eigh-
teenth century, the unique character and value of Sicily’s cultural and natural patrimony was already 
recognised. In 1745  under Bourbon rule, royal 
edicts were issued to protect both the ancient ruins at Taormina and a forest of huge chestnut 
trees near Mount Etna. The industrious and en -
light ened prince of Biscari, Ignazio V Paterno 
(1719–1786), transformed his residence into a 
museum to house his collection of antiquities, including material that he recovered from Catania. His contemporary, the prince of T orremuzza 
Gabriele Castello (1727 –1794), was a passionate 
expert on coins and inscriptions. T ogether the two 
learned princes were appointed royal guardians  of Sicilian antiquities and monuments in 1779 . 
From these strong antiquarian roots, Sicily 
developed a robust and distinguished tradition  of archaeological investigation. Antonino Salinas 
(1841 –1914 ) studied in Germany before becoming 
a professor at the University of Palermo and 
director of the archaeological museum there. The prolific scholar Paolo Orsi (1859 –1935 ) dedicated 
his life to the study of prehistoric and Classical MORGANTINA

Mosaics of putti fishing were a stock theme of  
mosaicists in north Africa, 
encapsulating a playful and romantic view of the sea, 
but one which may have 
served also as a reminder of the importance of fishing as an essential part of the economy in maritime prov-inces. This one was laid by Africans working on com-
mission in a villa in the 
heart of Sicily. Detail of a Roman mosaic, cupids

Sjöqvist and Richard Stillwell; over the subsequent 
decades large portions of the city have been 
uncovered and systematically recorded. The site has provided a training ground for generations  of archaeologists. By invitation of Sjöqvist, the 
Swedish king Gustav VI Adolph spent time at the 
site during several of the early seasons. Since 1989, excavations have been overseen by Malcolm Bell 
III from the University of Virginia joined by  
Carla Antonaccio from Duke University. 
With such archaeological riches have come cor-
responding challenges. The attraction of the lucra-tive illegal art market and difficulties of security have resulted in the looting of archaeological sites, notably the relatively remote location of Morgan-
tina. In 2010 , a group of 15  highly ornamented gilt 
silver bowls, cups and implements in the collec-
tions of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New 
Y ork were determined to have been stolen from 
Morgantina. An agreement was struck to ‘share custody’ of the artefacts between New Y ork and the Museo Archeologico Regionale in Aidone, 
near the ancient city. A year later, the J. Paul Getty 
Museum in Los Angeles restituted to the same museum in Aidone a monumental limestone-  
and-marble acrolithic (composite) sculpture of a goddess also attributed to Morgantina, followed by a brightly painted terracotta head of Hades in 2014 . 
In 1999, an exquisite gold phiale (sacrificial dish) 
recovered from the art market in the US was returned to the archaeological museum in Himera. These restitutions have provoked debates on how 
to protect and present Sicily’s heritage and attract 
visitors, both locals and tourists, to the many smaller sites and museums on the island. 
Since 1977 , Sicily has been divided into nine 
archaeological superintendencies to supervise  the monuments, sites and museums in each region.  
A law passed in 2000  facilitated the creation of 
archaeological parks, areas that preserve ancient ruins within their natural landscape. Recent  excavations have attracted wide publicity, such  
as the dramatic find in excavations headed by  
Stefano Vassallo of skeletons from the Battle of Himera fought between the Greeks and the Car-thaginians in 480 BC. The series ‘Archaeology in

"173IN ANOTHER COUNTRY: SICILY ON THE SILVER SCREEN
‘In another country, they would have been 
honoured like national heroes.’ The 2005  
documentary In un altro paese (In Another Country) cries out against the way Gio-
vanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, prominent fighters against the Sicilian mafia, were treated 
after they had taken to court hundreds of mafiosi 
by the end of the 1980 s. Their work met with 
resistance in the obscure back-rooms of the Italian 
authorities; the two magistrates were left to their 
own resources and, an easy prey for the mob, they ended a few years later as ‘excellent cadavers’.  
The lives of Falcone and Borsellino and the fight against the Cosa Nostra in general turned out to be a popular subject in recent Italian cinema,  
from I cento passi (The Hundred Steps, Marco Tullio 
Giordana, 2000 ) to La mafia uccide solo d’estate  
(The Mafia Only Kills in Summer, Pierfrancesco 
Diliberto, 2013 ). They are well-meaning, but rather 
melodramatic docudramas, while in fact the raw 
reality on Sicily doesn’t need any frills, as In un 
altro paese proves. Y et even that realistic documen-
tary’s title already follows the cliché of Sicily as typical of the other Italy, where everything is  
different. That’s how Sicily, the cradle of the  
Italian nation-state thanks to Garibaldi, is usually presented on the screen: as an exaggerated version of Italy and therefore an enlarged symbol of the 
exotic. This image comes to the fore in interna-
tional productions such as the famous Godfather 
trilogy, in which Sicily again and again acts as a 
sun-drenched overseas haven. But it is at least as 
dominant in Italian cinema, where Sicily is like-wise portrayed as different, as another country outside the normal world, and possibly even  
outside human reality. As the prince of Salina, the 
main character in the Sicilian film par excellence,  Il gattopardo (The Leopard, Luchino Visconti, 1963) 
remarks about Garibaldi’s invasion: ‘They have come to teach us good manners; but they will fail, for we are gods.’ No country for mortal heroes, but for self-appointed gods.
The prince of Salina is addressing a civil servant 
from Turin who as a passer-by has a silent but piv-otal part in the film, which is based on Giuseppe     In Another

SICILY AND THE SEA  SICILY IN THE ARTISTIC IMAGINATION
T omasi di Lampedusa’s novel with the same title. 
The civil servant has arrived on Sicily shortly after 
Garibaldi’s invasion and is trying to understand a 
little of the southern ways. Sweating profusely in his impeccable suit, he represents the ‘normal’ mainland world, a nosey outsider who is con-
fronted with stark Sicilian reality and with the 
prince of Salina’s sonorous one-liners. This con-trast between insiders and outsiders turns up again 
and again in films on Sicily, reinforcing the island’s 
image as strange and exotic. Outsiders who come and go, migration, exile, escapades, mysterious dis-
ap pearances: they all dramatise the gap between 
Sicily and the rest of the world. 
That gap is embodied symbolically and geo-
graphically by the sea — the bitter sea: ‘Il mare è 
amaro’ is the opening sentence of La terra trema (The Earth Trembles). This raw, realistic drama that Visconti made in 1948 was again based on a novel, 
I Malavoglia (The Malavoglias, 1881 ) by Giovanni 
Verga. The film tells of the bitter fate of a fisher-
man’s family near Catania facing exploitation, 
misery and poverty. Once more a silent intruder plays a central role: with his long leather coat and endless supply of American cigarettes, he seduces 
one of the brothers into starting a new life over-
seas. The brother disappears, leaving his family in dire circumstances. The bitter sea, source of food 
and life, is also the escape route to a different 
world and thus the physical and mental divide between Sicily and the mainland. And that main-land still beckons, as shown in Emanuele Crialese’s 
2011 film Terraferma, a modern variation on Vis-
conti’s La terra trema. Its story, too, is that of a fish-
erman’s family, mangled by economic misfortunes 
and unfair authorities; again, there is much heated 
debate (always in Sicilian dialect, just as in La terra trema) on the possibility of emigration. But then modern reality moves in as African boat refugees 
come face to face with summer tourists — two 
perfect examples of modern outsiders. The fisher-
man’s son tries to approach both and finally joins 
the refugees in an attempt to cross to the main-
land. 
This combination of immigrants and emigrants 
is a returning theme in Sicilian cinema. Kaos (Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, 1984) begins with the 
complaint of a lonely mother whose sons have left for America long ago. There the gold shimmers, 
here we have a vale of tears, she says: ‘una terra di 
pianto’. Never again has she heard of her sons; over and over she tries to reach them by handing 
illegible letters to other outcasts who are embark-
ing for the New World. Nuovomondo, an earlier Crialese film from 2006, depicts the fate of those fortuneseekers in a dreamy, sometimes absurdist 
way reminding strongly of Kaos — and thus of 
Luigi Pirandello’s world, the film’s source of inspi-ration. On Sicily, literature is never far away from 
cinema. Kaos ends with an epilogue in which 
Pirandello, the outsider himself now, returns to his place of birth and talks with the ghost of his 
mother. She tells him about her youth, when she 
had to leave Sicily as an exile: a nostalgic memory of forced emigration overseas, accompanied by the aria L’ho perduta (I Lost It) from Mozart’s Figaro. 
LA TERRA TREMA 
‘Il mare è amaro’ (‘the  
sea is bitter’): thus opens 
La terra trema, Luchino Visconti’s raw 1948 drama about a poor fisherman’s 
family near Catania.  
The bitter sea is the source of life and food, but also the route to emigration for 
one of the sons, leaving  
his family behind in their misery."
"175IN ANOTHER COUNTRY: SICILY ON THE SILVER SCREENand Baarìa from 2009), but equally of exiles seek-
ing refuge: the character of Pablo Neruda in Il 
postino (The Postman, 1994 ), partly shot on Salina, 
one of the Aeolian Islands north of Sicily; Ingrid 
Bergman in Roberto Rossellini’s Stromboli, terra di Dio (1950 ), playing a Lithuanian refugee ending 
up on Stromboli, another Aeolian Island; Nanni Moretti in his Caro diario (Dear Diary, 1993 ), 
escaping hectic urban life on the Aeolian Islands as 
well. The photogenic small volcanic islands 
become the superlative of Sicily, where the exotic is stressed even more. That is definitely true of 
L’avventura (Michelangelo Antonioni, 1960), a 
merciless portrait of modern escapism. A young 
woman from the Roman bourgeoisie disappears without a trace on a deserted little island near 
Panarea (the second smallest Aeolian Island), 
whose only inhabitant is a migrant returned from Italy — a twofold outsider. The woman’s boyfriend 
immediately seduces her best friend and a doomed relationship develops against the back-drop of Noto’s Baroque façades and snow-covered Mount Etna over Taormina.
The continuing popularity of this intangible 
Sicily is demonstrated by the TV series Il commissa-rio Montalbano, consistently drawing millions of 
viewers in Italy. Salvo Montalbano, an inspector in 
the fictional town Vigatà, lives on the seashore and spends his days swimming, enjoying copious meals and solving strange mysteries. In every episode, 
the story line borders on the bizarre, so that  
ultimately Sicily itself is the central subject of the series. Sicily is like Montalbano: his girlfriend 
Livia lives in Genoa and visits every now and  
then but, being an outsider, never succeeds in really making Montalbano hers. Sicily is another 
country, after all. 
TERRAFERMA 
The interaction between 
immigrants and emigrants 
is a recurring theme in  Sicilian film. In Terraferma (Emanuele Crialese, 2011), 
African refugees come face 
to face with tourists and  a fisherman’s son has to make his choice. 
PANARIA FILM The world of the Aeolian Islands and 
the surrounding sea is beautifully por -
trayed in the documentaries of Panar -
ia Film. This production com pany, es-
tablished by the Sicilian nobleman Francesco Alliata di Villafranca after 
the Second World War, pioneered un-derwater filming in the deep blue sea around Stromboli. In their first docu-
mentary, Cacciatori sottomarini (‘Un-
derwater Hunters’) from 1946, Alliata  
and his aristocratic friends wonderful-ly visualised life under the surface, 
where divers and their prey of fish 
and turtles struggle for existence be-tween the sea and the volcano. Other documentaries followed in subse-
quent years, in cluding Isole di cenere 
(‘Islands of Ashes’, 1947) and Tra 
Scilla e Cariddi (‘Between Scylla and 
Charybdis’, 1948).Mother and son fleetingly meet again, but the 
melancholy of loss predominates.

‘My country! Sweet, uncaring father-
land! At last I return to you, dear 
land of my ancestors: I kiss you.’  
A heartfelt, if slightly ambiguous 
greeting to Sicily marks the vocal entrance of the eponymous hero of Gioacchino Rossini’s opera 
T ancredi (1813 ): a young knight, betrayed, in love, 
exiled and searching for happiness with his be -
loved — or, if he can’t have that, death. There is 
vengeance in his heart, for he has been wronged by an ‘empio traditore’, an evil traitor whom he wishes to strike down.
In the opera, Tancredi makes his entrance in  
a ship which lands at a seaside garden. The music which accompanies that entrance makes for a wondrous moment: a pulsating figure in the 
woodwinds gives the impression of the ship sli-
ding through the water, while the higher strings seem to render a gentle summer breeze. Although 
according to the stage directions in the libretto 
the audience sees Tancredi arrive in the garden, the music suggests that we are actually on the ship with the knight, making our way with him to -
wards the beautiful Sicily he has missed so much 
during his absence from it. Composer Rossini (1792–1868 ) creates a filmic impression before 
there was ever such a thing as film.
The story of Tancredi takes place around the 
year 1000 : Sicily is divided by battles and conflicts 
between the Byzantines and the Saracens. There  
is trouble within the city-state of Syracuse too: 
while it tries to remain independent from both parties, the Argirio and Orbazzano families quarrel 
with each other. Orbazzano’s fraction gets the 
upper hand, so Argirio sends his wife and his daughter Amenaide to the Byzantine court,  where Amenaide meets another Syracusan exile: 
Tancredi. He is a Sicilian knight of Norman 
descent, driven from the island by xenophobe local nobles. Amenaide is wooed by the Saracen 
Solamir, but falls in love with Tancredi and at her 
mother’s deathbed is betrothed to him. Mean-while in Sicily, Syracuse is getting from bad to 
worse: Argirio, now in charge, has Amenaide 
return to Sicily. He wants her to marry Orbazzano in order to unify the noble parties. In the mean -time, the Saracen Solamir also wants to wed her, 
offering peace in return.
This is how things stand when the opera 
begins. The put-upon Amenaide, learning that Tancredi has set foot on Sicily too, writes him a 
letter, imploring him to return to her. Since he is a condemned man now — he has been sentenced 
to death, while his fortune has been given to 
Orbazzano — ,she avoids using her name. That 
works out much less well than she anticipated: as 
the letter is intercepted near the camp of Solamir, 
it is generally assumed that she is in love with the 
Saracen. She is condemned to death. Tancredi, believing her to be guilty, nevertheless acts as her champion and kills Orbazzano. He then takes on 
Solamir: he defeats him and, near death, Solamir 
convinces him of Amenaide’s innocence. At the Venice performances of the opera, Tancredi     Rossini’s Aria that

returns victorious and marries Amenaide. At later 
performances in Ferrara, he himself is mortally 
wounded and, before he dies, makes up with 
Amenaide, who explains the truth to him.
The happy ending was instated by librettist Gae-
 tano Rossi and differs from the opera’s source:  
Voltaire’s tragedy T ancrède (1760). It was used in 
Venice because early nineteenth-century audiences 
did not respond favourably to sadness at the end  
of an evening of opera. However, the Ferrara ver-sion — probably created at the suggestion of writer Luigi Lechi — with Tancredi’s death at the end was 
considered lost for a long time: only the textbook 
seemed to have survived. It wasn’t until around the 
mid-1970 s that it became possible to reconstruct 
the Ferrara version with the tragic ending.
That version stayed closer to Voltaire’s tragedy. 
In the play, Tancrède only makes his first entrance in the third act: he is happy to return to Sicily and sends one of his men to Amenaide. Then he muses 
about his love for both the island and his fiancée, 
convincing himself that she will have remained ROSSINI’S ARIA THAT CELEBRATES THE LOVE FOR THE FATHERLAND

her again and even fighting for her when he 
believes that she betrayed him. One could say that 
Amenaide is Sicily and Tancredi is the only one 
who truly, deeply loves her. We never get a fair impression of the Saracen Solamir, as he remains off stage during the course of the opera, posing an 
erotic threat to Amenaide and a powerful threat to 
Sicily. In the Venice version, he proves himself an honest man when solving the misunderstandings 
between Amenaide and Tancredi. In the later  
Ferrara version this aspect of his character has  disappeared.
When Tancredi’s words first rang out in the 
T eatro la Fenice, Venice, on 6 February 1813 ,  
while he entered the garden of Argirio’s palace, the audience heard a distinctly female voice, that 
of contralto Adelaïde Malanotte. The young  
Rossini cast some of the heroes of his serious  operas with this voice type, as it reminded him  
of the nobility and sound of the castratos he had 
heard in his youth. Thus he glances back at the classical opera of the eighteenth century, while at the same time making way for romanticism 
through his music: Tancredi’s entrance aria is so 
moving precisely because he pours out his roman-tic yearning with classical restraint.
T ancredi conquered Europe and was seen by 
some, including most notably Stendhal, as Rossi-ni’s highest achievement. With the faster section of Tancredi’s entrance aria, Rossini even created 
what in modern times could be called a ‘top hit’: 
‘Di tanti palpiti’, in which the hero asks the absent Amenaide’s forgiveness for the pain he has caused 
her during their time apart and foresees a happy 
future for them together, started a life of its own, more or less disembodied from the popular opera 
to which it belonged. Arrangements were made 
for different instruments, so that the melody could be played even without singers around. Ludwig van Beethoven had it sung at the world premiere 
of one of his symphonies to lure a large audience 
into the concert hall. Much later, Richard Wagner, ever a bit resentful of other composers’ successes, 
parodied it in the Tailors’ Chorus of his opera Die 
Meistersinger von Nürnberg. Contraltos and sopranos took it into their repertoire, adding their own vocal decorations to the melody as they went 
along. T oday the aria can be found on recital discs 
of female singers, some of whom have sung the true to him, despite the threat of her becoming  
the wife of Orbassan (as he is called in the play). 
Tancrède’s love for Sicily is almost equal to his love 
for Amenaide, as he makes clear (act III, scene 2 ):
Far from Caesar’s camps and far from Illyria,Finally, I come to the shores of my country,Of my ungrateful country which in my 
misfortune,
After Amenaide, is so dear to my heart!
When in the opera Tancredi starts the slow  
section of his aria, the text indicates that he is 
talking to Amenaide, who has not yet emerged from the palace, but he could just as well be addressing Sicily, the island on which he has just 
set foot:
Y ou who set this heart afire,Y ou who awaken my courage,
Glory of my soul, sweet love,Join me in my noble desire:
Strike down an evil traitor,
And crown my constancy.(transl. Lucy E. Cross)
For Amenaide and Sicily suffer much the same 
fate: her father Argirio, the nobleman Orbazzano, 
the Saracen Solamir and Tancredi quarrel over  
her much as they quarrel over Sicily itself. Within 
this group, Tancredi stands out: Orbazzano and Solamir merely desire her, her father Argirio loves her but uses her as a peace treaty, and only Tan-
credi is in love with her, risking his own life to see

In the throes of the war

Empire and the Saracens, internal conflicts arise in the microcosm of the is-

woman Amenaide’s secret love for the soldier Tancre-di is condemned as an act

"179nemici io trovo fin gli elementi. (‘I’m still alive! 
Even the elements are my enemies.’) Bent on 
revenge, he thinks of his other enemy first: 
Ernesto, the man who drove him from the island after defeating him in battle. Although he imme-diately claims to have thought of no-one else dur-
ing his ten years of absence, it is only then that his 
thoughts turn to his beloved Imogene, whom he left on the island: is she still faithful to him? Fur-
ther on in the opera Gualtiero will discover that 
in fact she is now the wife of his nemesis. Like Tancredi, Gualtiero devotes an aria to his beloved. 
In contrast to Tancredi’s restraint, Gualtiero’s fiery 
singing is the musical depiction of that new phe-nomenon of Romantic times: the Byronic anti-hero. Most importantly, the voice expressing these 
emotions is a male one, a tenor. At the world pre-
miere of the opera it was the great Giovanni Bat-tista Rubini, a veteran of se  ve ral Rossini operas, 
who was trained by Bellini himself in a new style 
of singing: less florid divisions in the music, increased attention to often-shifting dramatic intensity, and expression of the word within the 
musical line. Still later, Eugène Scribe’s libretto for 
Le Duc d’Albe by Gaetano Donizetti (1797 –
1848) — about the Duke of Alva and the Flemish-
Spanish conflict — is changed into Les Vêpres sicili-
ennes (1855 ) for Verdi: it concerns the Sicilians’ 
revolt against the French in 1282. Procida, the leader of the Sicilian resistance, returns from a 
three-year exile and sings a beautiful aria to his 
native city called ‘Et toi, Palerme’.
Rossini’s T ancredi was out of fashion for a good 
many years, yet has returned to the stages of the world now that there seems to be a larger group of fine performers capable of singing the title role, 
as well as sopranos and tenors who have been 
trained to deal with Rossini’s technically difficult writing for the roles of Amenaide and Argirio. There are many operas which take place some-
where in Sicily — Berlioz’s Béatrice et Benedict 
(1862), Mascagni’s Cavalleria rusticana (1890 ) and 
Król Roger (1926 ) by Szymanovski are three widely 
different examples — , but Rossini’s T ancredi stands 
out.title role on stage, such as Marilyn Horne (who was largely responsible for bringing the opera 
back into the limelight), Vessalina Kasarova and Ewa Podlès. Oddly, an alternative aria exists for 
Tancredi’s entrance scene, called ‘Dolci d’amor 
parole’. It was probably requested by Malanotte, because she may have found the original aria not to her liking. The alternative lacks the beautiful 
orchestral opening, but it boasts a beautiful violin 
solo and harks back to the Baroque era by using an echo voice which repeats parts of Tancredi’s 
utterings in a way that one finds in operas by 
Vivaldi and his contemporaries. The alternative aria however never became anywhere near as famous as ‘Di tanti palpiti’.
Such was the popularity of Rossini that young 
composers were faced with the seemingly insur-mountable dilemma of imitating Rossini or find-
ing their own way, risking to be severely criticised 
for either choice. Vincenzo Bellini (1801 –1835 ), 
while influenced by Rossini, managed to escape 
this fate. In fact he composed an opera to a li  bret-
 to by Felice Romani in which the title character 
returns to Sicily after a long exile: Il Pirata (1827) was a success and a clear sign that times were 
changing. Its hero, called Gualtiero, is outlawed 
like Tancredi; however he is not a noble knight, but a former count of Montaldo turned pirate. He 
doesn’t arrive on Sicilian shores in a gentle breeze, 
but is shipwrecked in a raging storm — mirroring 
the protagonist’s inner torment — and rescued by 
fishermen. He arrives supported by his companion 
and is at first unaware of his whereabouts, so there 
is no greeting for Sicily: ‘Io vivo ancor. A me ROSSINI’S ARIA THAT CELEBRATES THE LOVE FOR THE FATHERLANDTROUBLED HOMECOMING  
This scene captures the 
moment when young  
Tancredi returns from  exile. His homecoming  demands a battle not only 
for the preservation of his

CHAPTER 8  MODERN SICILY
"181
Sicily’s strategic location once more  
played an important part in European  
history when in May 1943 the Allied 
supreme command gave the go-ahead to 
Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily.
After the capitulation of France in July 1940, 
the United Kingdom had been the sole European power to withstand Hitler’s Third Reich and Mussolini’s Italy for almost a year. Although this 
period had ended with Hitler’s invasion of the 
Soviet Union in June 1941 , mutual mistrust and 
the immense geographical distance had prevented 
a joint British-Russian strategy. In any case, the 
largest part by far of the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe was now occupied with the Red Army; the threat of a German invasion of the British Isles had been 
averted for the time being.
When Hitler declares war on the United States 
in December of that year — after the Japanese 
attack on the American naval base of Pearl  
Harbor — , the British war fortune takes a turn  
for the better. Though many Americans see Japan as the most important enemy, President Roosevelt 
decides to give priority to the war in Europe 
(‘Germany First’), to the immense relief of British prime minister Winston Churchill, who is now 
certain that the war will be won. Moreover, with 
the Americans a joint battle plan can be made.
The British chiefs of staff manage to stop their 
American colleagues from forcing a landing on 
the French coast as soon as possible, but it is clear 
that the Western Allies will have to produce some quick results nonetheless. Only decisive action will help to restore British confidence and to diminish 
Stalin’s considerable mistrust. A compromise is 
decided on: a landing on the only battleground where British and German/Italian troops are  actually facing one another, North Africa. In 
November 1942 the Americans succeed in landing 
in Algeria, which is controlled by the French Vichy government, after some brief resistance  
by the French troops (Operation T orch). As they 
march east, they meet with the German and  Italian troops who had fought the British in 
Egypt. The German general Rommel sees that  
his chance of success is gone; after his departure on 9 March, the Italians and Germans capitulate in May 1943. 
When the military campaign in North Africa 
entered its final phase, Roosevelt and Churchill had agreed at Casablanca in January 1943 that the 
next step would have to be the conquest of Sicily 
in order to wipe the entire Mediterranean clean of enemy warships, but they had not decided on any further steps yet. 
Churchill and Roosevelt certainly weren’t 
ready for the big invasion across the Channel, where the German defences were very strong.  
In the United Kingdom an invasion force was 
being built up for the final landing in the north of France. But it required great numbers of soldiers and vast quantities of materiel, most of which had 
to come from the United States. Especially the 
Americans preferred to wait until the moment The Invasion

rule as soon as it comes under attack: their strike 
has to be swift. 
German supreme command understood all too 
well that the Allies wanted to reach the southern coast of Europe over the Mediterranean, but were uncertain as to where the landing would take 
place. British military intelligence had succeeded 
in creating confusion by having a corpse in an English officer’s uniform wash up on the Spanish coast with a caseful of fake landing plans describ-

Sicily was not immediately anticipated.

North Africa, taking a zigzag course to confuse 
the enemy until the last moment as to its destina-
tion. Apart from the very highest officers and the navigators, no one on board knows where the 
fleet is heading; the men are only told once they 
are under way. The original plan was to spread the invasion force over as big a stretch of the Sicilian south coast as possible, but at the last moment the 
British general Montgomery voices his objections 
against this strategy. The American supreme com-was there for this big operation; they had serious objections to continuing the Mediterranean  campaign on the grounds that people and materiel 
shouldn’t be used for what they considered a side 
show. Stalin, on the other hand, kept insisting for the Western Allies to start a second front in order to take some of the immense pressure off the now 
successful Red Army. Churchill in particular was 
not impervious to Stalin’s demands and moreover was not the man to have his armies twiddling their thumbs with the enemy still undefeated.
After the capitulation of Rommel’s desert army, 
the Mediterranean is the British and US navy’s domain. That makes a naval operation less danger-
ous there than on the French coast, where the 
German navy and the Luftwaffe are serious threats. The Italian navy, the only enemy on the 
Mediterranean, has practically been destroyed, 
while the Italian air force has sustained huge losses. Italy is perceived as an easier target than  
the Third Reich in any case, because its military  
is far weaker and the discontent with the fascist regime undermines the loyalty of the Italian army. On the other hand, the Allies have to reckon with 
a German intervention to support Mussolini’s  BOMBING OF PANTELLERIA 
Preceding the invasion  
of Sicily, the island of  
Pantelleria — in a highly strategic location between Tunisia and Sicily — was 
heavily bombarded by sea 
and air in early June 1943, so that it could serve as an air base for Operation 
Husky in July. The bomb-
ings wreaked such havoc that the garrison on  
Pantelleria surrendered  
as soon as the British troops landed on 11 June.

"183THE INVASION OF SICILY IN 1943 ed on Sicily, while the Allies land a mere 80 ,000 
men during the first few days; yet many Italians 
surrender immediately and the stream of prisoners 
of war is overwhelming. 5,000  Allied soldiers are 
killed against 9,000  fighting for the Italian-Ger-
man axis. American soldiers report on the desper-
ate poverty and primitive circumstances in which 
they find civilians, even compared to the inhabit-ants of the North African desert.
All kinds of things go wrong during the land-
ing and the subsequent campaign; things are made worse by Montgomery’s (and to a lesser degree 
Patton’s) obstinacy and hunger for fame, and the 
growing mutual dislike between Americans and British. 
In his headquarters at Frascati near Rome,  
the German field marshal Kesselring realises that Sicily is lost, but helped by Allied blunders he  
manages to evacuate most of his troops to the 
mainland before they are cut off. The Allies will 
come to regret this later in the war. But for now, Operation Husky is a success. On 25  July Mussolini 
is deposed and arrested; Rome has been bombed 
for the first time and Sicily is practically conquered. 
Around 16 August the last Axis troops that haven’t 
been taken prisoner leave the island. Their depar-
ture marks the beginning of the end of Italy’s  
war effort against the Allies. The new ruler, General 
Badoglio, starts negotiations that lead to a truce.  
By then the Wehrmacht has taken over the military 
activities in Italy; there will be two more years of 
bloodshed on the southern front. 
During this period Sicily was governed by  
an organ called Allied Military Government of Occupied T erritories (AMGOT). The Americans were particularly hailed and favoured by the  
landowners, who often had contacts in New Y ork 
through the mafia. Even after the war, support from this group remained vigorous, so much so that some wanted to see in Sicily the forty-ninth 
state of the USA. Others, such as the communist 
professor Antonino Canepa from Caltanisetta in his pamphlet La Sicilia ai Siciliani (Sicily to the  
Sicilians) fanned the Sicilian desire for independ-
ence. The status of autonomous region which the island regained in May 1946 turned out to be the most desirable option, also when Italy became a 
republic by the referendum of June 1946. mander, General Eisenhower, finally accepts the 
concentration of troops that his British colleague wants, although even Admiral Cunningham, the supreme commander of the British Navy, prefers  
a broad front. Montgomery’s stubbornness will 
increasingly irritate particularly the Americans in the course of the war.
After a terrible storm that poses a serious threat 
to the operation, the Allies land in the night of  9 July 1943 over a front of about 150  km in the 
south-east corner of the island; the British under 
Montgomery, the Americans under the equally 
eccentric General Patton. Bombings and airborne landings have preceded the landing. Before noon 
on 10  July, Gela falls into American hands. Despite 
a counterattack mostly by the small German units 
on the island and a number of Allied casualties  by friendly fire, the invasion goes rather smoothly. 
Nearly 300 ,000 Italian soldiers have been statio n-

TOMASI DI LAMPEDUSA AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR  
Because of the content of his work, Giuseppe 
Tomasi di Lampedusa (1896–1957) is mostly 
associated with the nineteenth century. Yet the Second World War looms large in his work.  The loss of old values and social structures that 
occurred a generation before his birth and that 
is such an important thread in all his posthu-mously published works has become final half  a century later. In Chapter 6 (‘The Ball’) of his 
iconic novel Il gattopardo (1958, translated into 
English as The Leopard), Lampedusa describes the painted deities on the ceiling of a Palermitan 
palace: ‘On the ceiling the gods looked down, 
reclining in golden seats, smiling but inexorable as the sky in summer. They believed themselves eternal, but a bomb made in Pittsburgh, Penn-
sylvania, was to prove the contrary to them in 
1943.’ The anachronism — the episode must be 
placed in November 1862 — is autobiographical 
to a certain degree. Not only is the main charac-
ter of the novel, the prince of Salina, an ancestor 
who witnesses the Sicilian nobility being overtak-en by the modern age against the backdrop of 
Italy during the Unification, but the ceiling is 
also part of the family palace which was bombed in 1943. In his book Memories of my Childhood Lampedusa in the chapter ‘The Places’ writes about the room where he was born and where 
he slept until age 46, a few months before the 
bombing: ‘So it will be very painful for me to bring back to memory that lamented place in all its unspoilt beauty (...) as it was to remain until  
5 April 1943, the day when the bombs flown in 
from the other side of the Atlantic found it and destroyed it.’ The house was Via di Lampedusa 17, later renumbered 23, not far from Via Roma 
and the harbour of Palermo. In the revolution 
year 1848 the house had already been hit by  a bomb that destroyed a magnificent painted 
ceiling in the so-called Great Hall. The adjacent 
ballroom is described as follows: ‘And then the ballroom with its lacquered floors and ceilings on which the exquisite gold and yellow swirls 
framed mythical scenes populated by all the 
gods of the Olympus, with their rough strength and flying garments.’ We may assume that the ballroom scene from Il gattopardo was modelled 
on this room. Then there is the lovely story  
The Sirene, telling of a famous Sicilian classicist and senator by the name of La Ciura who has  
an affair with a seductive sirene of the type  
that tried to strand Odysseus and many others on her rocks. In the end, the classicist dies on board a ship named Rex, headed for Naples. The story ends with the narrator, a soldier in  
Libya, describing how an antique wine-mixing 
vase from La Ciura’s heritage with a painting  of Odysseus on his ship falls to pieces in the classicist’s Palermitan home during a bombing 
by ‘Liberators’: American B-24s, a type of  
long-range heavy bomber. The war kept haunting Lampedusa. New  fragments are still being published in various 
languages (recently in Italian, with translations 
into French, English, and Dutch), from the  legacy of the author who saw the past dissolve 
into the present: gifts to the Old World and to  
the world at large.   DIEDERIK BURGERSDIJK

‘The task is difficult but your skill,  
courage and devotion to duty will  
be successful in driving our enemies 
closer to disaster and leading us towards 
victory and the liberation of Europe and Asia.’
This is the ending phrase of the preface  
General Eisenhower wrote for the Soldier’s Guide to Sicily, a booklet containing historical, geograph-
ical, political and social information about the 
Mediterranean island and its inhabitants.
In the night of 9  July 1943 the largest amphibi-
ous operation of World War II was put into effect. ’Operation Husky’ was based on rapidity and sec-recy, so that only the high-ranking officers were aware of the target of the expedition, which was 
revealed to the rest of the men on the eve of the 
landing. Every soldier of the Allied army was sup-plied with the top-secret guide, providing useful 
information about the habits of the population and 
the political situation of the island (which was a stronghold of the German-Italian axis). Thus the Allies were warned against the jealous and violent 
nature of Sicilian men — p. 6 — as well as against the 
numerous diseases that thrived on the island, due  
to the primitive life conditions of its inhabitants —  
p. 13. Moreover, Sicily’s political/administrative 
organisation was described in detail, from the 
names of all the island’s podestà (mayors) to the identities of the stationmasters of every single town. 
Despite the thorough preparation of the inva-
sion, the Allies ran into several obstacles before landing: a storm that slowed them down and a strong wind that made the paratroopers lose their 
orientation. Nevertheless, at the dawn of 10  July 
1943, the English and American troops arrived in 
Gela, a fishing village on the south-west coast, where only an incomplete garrison of Axis troops 
defended the place from bunkers and casemates. 
Remnants of the fortifications can still be seen  on the hills near the coast, not only in Gela, but 
along the southern and northern shores of Sicily. 
Many are intact to this day, while others show traces of the American attack. They were built  
of 60-cm-thick concrete, equipped with three 
embrasures that allowed the soldiers a 270° line  
of vision and moreover protected them from the splinters caused by bullets hitting the surface.  
The holes created by hostile fire are still visible 
today. From this type of fortification, soldiers of the Livorno and Hermann Göring Divisions 
engaged the Allies, but due to the surprise of the 
attack and their low numbers they were defeated. 
From this moment onward, the British and 
American advance seemed unstoppable. It contin-
ued in two directions. The terrain to the north-
east was quickly conquered by the British forces of General Bernard Montgomery; General George 
S. Patton’s American troops went to the north-
west. At first, the British army apparently found  an easy path to the east, since the bases of Avola, Pachino, Noto and Syracuse fell after very little 
resistance. However, the last strong opposition of 
the Axis troops was concentrated in the area of Landing in Sicily:

Centuripe, a key point in the German-Italian de - 
fence line. This region was thought to be impreg-
nable because of the steep hills that surrounded it; 
on the slopes of these hills many traces of the bat-tle that took place there from 2 to 4 August have recently been discovered. Gun-shell fragments, 
empty ration cans and even a gas-mask container 
belonging to a German soldier that went unno-ticed for nearly seventy years testify to the struggle 
that occurred in the area. One of the most inter-
esting and evocative remains found in this place is the name of a German soldier, Hugo Müller, 
engraved on the wall of a Bronze Age rock-cut 
tomb. According to studies by the Istituto per i Beni Archeologici e Monumentali (Institute of Archaeological and Monumental Heritage) of the 
National Research Council (CNR), the state-ments of some paratroopers caught by the British 
soldiers could shed light on the presence of this 
Hugo Müller in the rock cleft. It seems that they 
waited in the most hidden places of the Centuripe hills to attack the enemy from the back, causing confusion among the ranks in order to delay their 
advance. Obviously, nothing certain can be said 
about the identity of the ‘engraver’, but from a search in the database of the Germans who fell or 
went missing during the war we can deduce that 
Müller survived the Sicilian campaign.
While the eastern German frontline with  drew 
to the Etna line and the Axis army was soon forced to leave the island, General Patton pres-sured the other leaders of the expedition — Gen-
eral Alexander and General Eisenhower — to give 
him the go-ahead for the conquest of Palermo. HANDBOOK IN ACTION

"187LANDING IN SICILY: SIGNS OF OPERATION HUSKY BUNKERS ON THE SICILIAN 
COAST 
Italian and German  
troops defended Sicily  from fortifications along  the coast. Many of these 
bunkers survive, often  
visibly damaged by Allied fire. Bunkers from World War II in Licata on the 
south-west coast. 
Actually this was an expression of vanity, a coup  
de théatre, rather than a real necessity for the suc-
cess of the expedition. The Sicilian capital had 
already suffered several exhausting attacks from the Allies, the latest one on 9 May 1943, which had destroyed most of the city. When Patton’s 
army marched in on 23  July, most of the enemies 
had already left, as well as the governor.
During the entire war, Palermo was one of  
the main strongholds of the Axis, and relevant 
traces of this are still present on Mount Pellegrino, the mountain that dominates the city. An unex-ploded — and still charged — bomb from that 
period was recently found there, just a few metres 
away from Castello Utveggio, the German anti-aircraft headquarters. Some have hypothesised  that this bomb was meant for General Mayer,  
the coordinator of the anti-aircraft operations,  
or for the numerous ‘Black Shirts’ stationed over the mountain. Mount Pellegrino was therefore  
a strategic point for military manoeuvres, as can 
be deduced as well from the strange circular struc-tures on it. They were locations for anti-aircraft 
machine guns, as can be inferred from the con-
crete ramp in the entrance and the small poles that secured them. Moreover, there are two big rooms, probably used as ammunition depots. There are 
dozens of these structures among the mountain’s 
hardy vegetation — one can still feel the essence  
of those terrible years here, despite the negligence 
of Sicilian authorities.A CHARGED BOMB ON MOUNT 
PELLEGRINO 
In 2013 a group of rangers 
discovered a bomb from World War II in the nature reserve on Mount Pellegri-
no. It was still charged; the 
fuse was damaged. During the war, Mount Pellegrino harboured a number of an-
ti-aircraft posts to protect

When we think of historic moments,  
it is often great, impressive events 
that come to mind: important peace 
treaties, influential speeches, bloody 
attacks. But sometimes history is written through slow-moving bureaucratic or political processes 
that seem insignificant when seen up close. The 
conference that was organised at Messina in June 1955 clearly falls into the latter category. When  
the Declaration of Messina was signed, none of  
the conference’s participants could assess the im -portance of this compromise. Y et the conference 
was a crucial moment in the history of European 
cooperation: in the Sicilian sunshine, with a view of the Mediterranean, six men decided to establish a commission that was to determine the history  
of the European countries for good.
Spring 1955 : the ‘European project’ has come  
to a dead end. The western-European countries’ 
interests and wishes differ greatly and after the 
failure of, among other things, the creation of a single European Defence Community, European integration seems farther away than ever. France 
had no wish to participate in a common European 
market, something that Germany was very keen on. On the other hand, France much favoured 
European collaboration on nuclear energy and 
weapons, but in that area German interests were the exact opposite. The United States, which had been closely involved in the European project 
until then, were gradually withdrawing. While the 
USA and the Soviet Union determined world politics, Europe was looking for ways to keep 
playing its part on the world stage. Since particu-
larly the Benelux countries expected direct eco-nomic gain from a stronger European cooperation, they take the initiative for a conference in the 
summer of 1955 . 
The ministers of Foreign Affairs from the six 
countries of the European Coal and Steel Com-munity (Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the 
Netherlands, and Luxemburg) will participate in the conference. Following a suggestion from the 
Italian minister of Foreign Affairs, the meeting will 
take place on Sicily, because at that moment he is involved in regional elections there. For the other European leaders, it is an attractive idea to organ-
ise a relatively small meeting in a beautiful, quiet 
place far from the hectic northern-European cit-ies. In a fairly relaxed atmosphere, with beautiful 
weather and a lovely view of the Mediterranean, 
chances of a positive outcome might be better. 
The delegations were lodged in nearby Taor-
mina, which determined the conference’s location: 
the town offered sufficient places for the diplo-
mats to stay. One member of the Belgian delega-tion, Jean-Charles Snoy et d’Oppuers, describes 
the situation in his memoirs, titled Rebâtir l’Europe. 
It was said that this was the first international  conference on Sicily since the Hohenstaufens. The weather was mild, Mount Etna veiled. On 1 June 
the conference started in Messina, but when the 
report was drawn up at the end of the first day the expectations and viewpoints turned out to diverge     The Messina

so much that the ministers had to be put up to 
speed in Taormina’s Hotel Domenico between  
2 and 4 a.m. — they had attended a ballet in the 
Graeco-Roman theatre first. The nightly talks  
created a good basis for overtures during the  second day, again in Messina. On 3 June the con-
ference was brought to a successful conclusion in 
the City Hall on the Piazza Municipio, with a wide view of Messina’s harbour. 
During the conference the differences were  
not resolved all at once, but the parties did agree on how to proceed. They chose a solution that 
was innovative at the time: creating a commission to investigate all the possibilities. It would be led by the liberal Belgian minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Paul-Henri Spaak. The intergovernmental com-mission would have to come to grips with two 
controversial issues: the creation of a common 
market and the establishment of a European com-munity for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. This 
interim solution initially was a disappointment to 
many; at the conference no real decisions had been made and Konrad Adenauer, the Ger  man 
chancellor, thought that it had focused too much 
on economic interests.
However, establishing the commission turned 
out to be a brilliant idea. This solution that came up in the warmth of the Sicilian sun proved an 
efficient way to boost European integration. On the basis of the report from Spaak’s commission, Euratom was established and, far more impor-
tantly, a common European market created. The 
Messina Conference is therefore regarded as the cause of the treaty signed in Rome two years later, 
in March 1957 , by which the European Economic 
Community was founded. This EEC was the  
predecessor of the European Union as we know it 
today.MESSINA CITY HALL

The name of Sicily evokes numerous asso-
ciations, many of which have already  
been discussed in this book. Greek tem-
ples and theatres; Roman villas; Norman 
influence; Baroque churches. Other, more culinary words: cannoli, torroni, amaretti, blood oranges. But 
for many people the island’s name still has darker 
associations, especially regarding its inhabitants. One of those people is Salvatore Modica, an 
economist at the University of Palermo. In 2012  
he vented his discontent in these furious sen-
tences: 
An Italian looking at Sicily sees corrupt  politics and a state that doesn’t help the weak nor foster the talented, but favours 
solely the friends of the powerful. He sees a 
region of absurd privileges and monopolies. He grows increasingly indignant at an 
autonomy that has not produced economic 
growth, but growth of debt and subsidies.
And Modica didn’t even use the words that 
come to mind first at the mention of Sicily, espe-
cially in a context of film: ‘mafia’, ‘Cosa Nostra’, ‘godfathers’. 
When I first visited Palermo in 1988  as a rookie 
correspondent, ‘mafia’ was a word that one assum- ed had to be whispered. A few years later, Ameri-
can journalists wore bulletproof vests when they 
visited Sicily — there probably was a good deal of 
naivety and stereotyping involved. At that time courageous Sicilian men and women had already been speaking out for years against the all-perva-
sive power of organised crime. But twenty-five years ago the public debate on the mafia was just beginning to take shape, fanned by pioneer may-
ors such as Leoluca Orlando (Palermo) and Enzo 
Bianco (Catania) and entrepreneurs such as Libero Grassi (killed in 1991  because he refused to pay 
‘protection money’). 
The assassination of mafia fighters Giovanni 
Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in May and July 
1992, followed by the arrest of ‘the boss of bosses’ 
T otò Riina in early 1993 , gave the fight against the 
mafia a big boost, making Sicily in 2015  very dif-
ferent from that of the 1980 s. Entrepreneurs and 
shop owners have united in an organisation called 
Addiopizzo (‘Bye, protection money’) which started in Palermo and spread to Catania, Messina 
and other Sicilian cities. Existing possibilities to  
hit the mafia where it hurts have been enhanced: confiscation of money and goods, a strict prison regime for convicted mafiosi. At the end of 2013 , 
over 600  companies and almost 5,000  buildings 
and estates had been seized. A symbolic victory  of the state over the mafia, although it turns out 
that effectively using such property is hugely 
problematic. 
Until the 1980 s, whoever spoke of the mafia 
mentioned omertà in the same breath: secrecy.

look the other way. During the San Remo Song Festival of 2007  a young singer, Fabrizio Moro, Modern Politics

Room has been created in Sicily, room for all 
those Sicilians who don’t want anything to do

ing political change. In the 2012  regional elections 
the Five-Star Movement, which explicitly dis-
tances itself from the old political parties, became the island’s biggest party, helped no doubt by Beppe Grillo’s election stunt: the driving force behind the party, in his sixties, swam the three  
kilometres separating Sicily from the mainland. 
On the other hand Sicily is still fighting an 
uphill battle. The way Sicilian parliamentarians 
have been lining their pockets is infamous in 
Italy — the Five-Star parliamentarians’ making  
part of their salaries available as venture capital  
for start-ups does little to change this. Important 
economic sectors such as chemistry, pharmaceuti-
cal industry and electronics are in trouble. While export has saved many Italian companies during 
the crisis with its halting internal market, Sicilian 
export went down by almost 14 % in 2014 . To  
summarise the analysis of the region’s Statistics Service: ‘In 2014 Sicily closed the seventh year  
of a negative cycle of declining production, loss  of jobs, a falling number of companies, and a  visible decline of the average standard of living.’ 
The effects of decades of bad government are 
still palpable; the intertwining of politics, society and organised crime remains problematic. At his wits’ end, Palermitan public prosecutor Vittorio PALERMO PORT

tious normalisation of Sicily, no matter how slow. 
Sergio Mattarella, elected president of Italy in  
January 2015 , is a case in point. He is the first 
Sicilian president since Italy’s Unification in 1861 . 
Mattarella’s father, a prominent Christian Demo-
crat on Sicily and in Rome, was suspected of 
being a link between mafia and politics in the 40s 
and 50s. Piersanti Mattarella on the other hand, the present president’s brother, was killed by the mafia in 1980  because he tried to prise agricul-
tural subsidies from its grip. In the years after that, the current president played an important part behind the scenes in the rise of Leoluca Orlando 
as the ‘antimafia mayor’ of Palermo. This personal 
history contradicts the great Sicilian writer T omasi di Lampedusa’s dictum, quoted all too often, that 
everything has to change for everything to stay 
the same. Sicily in fact is trying to stay the same no longer, when it comes to the mafia and its 
integration into politics and society. T eresi even appealed to the godfathers in prison: 
‘Sever the ties with the politicians you are in touch with. Y ou’re getting one life sentence after 
another while they always get off scot-free, they 
enrich themselves, and all of them remain at large.’
In its most recent survey the Direzione  
Investigativa Antimafia concludes that the Sicilian 
Cosa Nostra and the Calabrian ’ndrangheta are 
each responsible for 6% of the mafia assassinations. That could lead to the assumption that those 
mafia gangs are less of a threat, but the contrary  
is true: it shows how perfectly organised they are. Less assassinations doesn’t equal less power; in fact 
it illustrates the change of structure in organised 
crime. Extortion remains important, but there is  a clear tendency toward infiltration in the  ‘normal’ economy. For the financial power of the 
mafia — all groups combined are often described 
as Italy’s biggest company — still is immense.

about the changes that have occurred in Sicily 
over the last decades. I have limited myself to  giving an impression of a few elements. With a large dose of good will one might speak of a cau-MEMORIAL TO MAFIA VICTIMS

"193SICILY AND ITS FISHESSicilians have long memories.  
Some years ago we were on holiday in  
Sicily. I phoned my mother — who is of 
Sicilian origin, although she was born in 
Rome —  to tell her that I was in Palermo; with-
out hesitation, she said to me: ‘Go to the Duomo 
and leave a rose on the tomb of our king.’ Of 
course, she was talking about the Emperor Freder-
ick II, who to many people (Sicilians, Germans or others) is still the Stupor Mundi, the Wonder of 
the World. Flowers are never missing on his sar-
cophagus, in tender and perpetual memory of one of the most suggestive figures of the Middle Ages. 
Frederick has always remained present in the 
imagination of the Sicilian people, to such an extent that he is also the co-protagonist of Cola-
pesce’s story.
Colapesce was a boy from Messina, it seems, 
who loved the sea more than anything else; when -
ever he was free, he would dive into the waves, 
where he disappeared without needing to breathe 
for many hours. When he came back to the sur -
face, he told people about the fabulous underwater 
world, about coral caves, charming mermaids, and 
horrible abyss fishes no one else had ever seen. His 
original name was Cola; pesce means ‘fish’.
The Emperor Frederick II, after becoming 
aware of such a prodigy, decided to put Colapesce 
to the test: he gathered his court on a ship and 
threw a goblet into the waves, asking Cola to bring it back up. The boy dove and in the blink  of an eye resurfaced with the cup in his hand: ‘Here, Y our Majesty, to serve you!’
Frederick, amused, ordered to bring the royal 
vessel further offshore, where the water was deeper, and threw the cup into the sea again,  asking the boy wonder to repeat the feat. Eagerly 
Cola dove again and, after a longer dive, he 
brought the goblet back to the emperor.
Still not satisfied, the emperor had the boat sail 
out to the high seas, where the waters were at 
their deepest, and asked Colapesce to repeat the 
test again. The boy dove into the abyss for the third time, but he never re-emerged again…
In a second version, Frederick asks the boy to 
find out what was hidden in the depths of the sea under Mount Etna. Cola plunged into the abyss, came back after a few minutes and said: 
‘There is a fire, an ever-burning fire, Y our  
Majesty!’‘A fire under the sea? This is not possible! Are 
you making fun of me, boy? Go back down and bring me proof!’
‘Majesty, you will have the proof you desire,  
but you will not see Colapesce anymore.’
‘Dive now, and let me have my evidence,’ said Frederick, imperious. Cola plunged in and 
never resurfaced. After a few minutes, a piece of 
wood that he had taken with him into the abyss, floated back up. And it was burned.
In yet another version of the legend, during his 
third and deepest dive, Cola makes an astonishing discovery and ends up supporting Sicily under     Sicily and

water, like a new Atlas (see Castellana’s contribu-
tion). The legend is connected to the myth of  
the sons of Neptune, who mated with mermaids 
(monk seals?) and had extraordinary powers, including the ability to hold their breath under water indefinitely.
In Italy, thinking of Sicily and fish is thinking 
of tuna and tonnara (the tuna fishing-nets), quite an epic pair.
Once, when the bluefin tuna (Thunnus thyn-
nus) was plentiful, the tonnare da corsa (lit. ‘racing tuna fishing-nets’) were widespread across the 
central-western Mediterranean. It was a net com-
plex that was lowered perpendicularly to the coast in order to catch the tunas that had come in from the Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar 
to lay their eggs in the warmer and saline basins 
of the central Mediterranean. In Sicily, this com-plex was commoner along the west coast, in the 
area of Trapani and the overlooking Aegadian 
Islands.
Thousands of fishes, each one weighing hun-
dreds of pounds, followed the ancient instinct and 
reached the shallow water along the coast until 
the school of tuna was intercepted by this vertical wall of networks coming down from the surface 
to a depth of forty metres. The tunas didn’t swim 
below this depth but followed the network that, like a maze, took them into one final area: the ‘House of Death’.
This part of the nets was the only one with a 
bottom, made of netting as well. By opening and closing bulkheads, the fishermen ushered the tunas 
into the House of Death. The whole operation, 
from the nets’ laying to the last act, was directed by the rais (an Arabic word for ’boss’), the director 
of the trap, an office that was handed down from 
father to son.
The last act was the mattanza (‘slaugh-
ter’ — see Castellana for further explanation of 
the ritual). Beside the House of Death lay some punts man ned by the tonnaroti, vigorous fisher-
men armed with grappling-hooks of different 
lengths. At the rais’ signal, the floor of the 
House of Death was gradually hoisted up by the 
fishermen, who sang songs of ancient Arabic origin, such as Aja mola Ajamola from the Arabic 
Ai Ai ya ... ya ... Maulay (‘Come, o my Creator, help us’).When the tunas felt the floor of the House of 
Death going up, they started swimming more and 
more nervously to the surface, where the tonnaroti 
were waiting for them. They harpooned the tunas with their hooks and, in a single effort, with strained faces and motivating screams, they shot 
the fishes into the boats, while the sea coloured 
red from the tunas’ blood. The last mattanza took place in Favignana in 2007 .
From one headland of the island to another, 
from Trapani to Messina; from one sea giant, the bluefin tuna, to another: the swordfish (Xiphias 
gladius).
The Strait of Messina has always been a place 
of great splendour. At this point the island and the 
continent face each other, just 3.2 km away. On 12  
December 1908 , a violent earthquake and the tsu-
nami that followed it surprised the inhabitants of the two cities on the Strait in their sleep, killing 
more than a third of them. This was due to the 
release of energy by three tectonic faults that coexist in the Strait. After the earthquake, the dis-tance between Sicily and Europe had increased by 
70 cm.
The great depths that are measured in this place 
at the meeting of the T yrrhenian and Ionian seas have always created strong tidal currents with 
whirlpools — probably the cause of the myth of 
the two sea monsters, Scylla (on the Calabrian coast) and Charybdis (on the Sicilian coast). The 
moment the T yrrhenian tide reaches its lowest 
point, the Ionian tide is at its highest, and vice versa. This breath of the sea creates an upward 
current, carrying with it abyssal fishes that once 
could be studied only here; the same currents bring nutrients to the surface that activate the 
food chain. For this reason, these waters have 
always been favourable to the predators at the top of the food chain: small and large cetaceans, tunas, sharks and swordfishes.
The swordfish fishing practiced in the Strait  
of Messina has unique and unmistakable charac-teristics.
When the sea is dead calm and it is easier to  
see through the clear water of the Strait, one could see a boat equipped especially for this type of fishing, the feluca, with a high mast in the centre 
as lookout, the ’ntinna (the Sicilian word for 
antenna) where the watch person (u ’ntinneri) 
SICILY AND THE SEA  MODERN SICILY"
"195SICILY AND ITS FISHES
Another ancient ritual was accompanying the 
recovery of the harpooned fish with songs in 
Greek, because this old language was thought to 
guard against losing the fish during this procedure. On some boats for nightly swordfish fishing, a red or blue globe was hoisted to the top of a pole at 
the bow. The globe was painted with the stars of 
the Great Bear, separated by a white band, proba-bly a legacy of the ancient Phoenician culture.
T oday fishing is done in motor boats equipped 
with a mast 20–25  metres high and an even longer 
bow gangplank measuring up to 40–45  metres on 
which the harpooner, u fureri, stands.
Now as then, when a couple of swordfishes is 
spotted, u fureri cruelly harpoons the female first, because the male, as a faithful partner, does not 
flee, but shares the fate of his mate until the end, 
as it is narrated by Domenico Modugno in his heart-breaking song U pisci spada.
No, no, no, no amuri miu!  No, no, no, no my love!Si tu muri vugghiu muriri ’nziemi a tia! 
If you die, I want to die with you!
Si tu muri, vugghiu murir…  If you die, I want to die…
In the third millennium AD, a primordial ritual 
is still renewed in these waters every summer, 
challenging the sea and honouring the defeated 
opponent. Who knows if Hemingway...stood. His job was to spot the swordfish swim-
ming near the surface, sometimes with the dorsal fin sticking out of the water.
The ’ntinneri were assisted by other lookouts  
on the mainland, the banniaturi (from banniare, 
the Sicilian word for ‘to scream’). When the fish was sighted, it was time for the capture, which 
was done by one or several smaller and agile 
boats called luntru. The luntru had a shorter mast 
in the centre, the farere, three metres high. On it 
was a second lookout, who had the task of lead-
ing four rowers to the goal: ’u pisci spada, the swordfish.
At the bow, on a short gangplank, stood the 
harpooner, u lanzaturi. Like the whalers of every sea, he held a shaft ending with a two-pointed harpoon, the draffinera, probably of Arabian origin. 
When the rowers brought u lanzaturi at a close 
distance from the swordfish, he hurled the har-poon into the flesh of the noble opponent, which 
was then recovered by pulling in the rope that tied 
the draffinera to the boat.
Once they were ashore, the fishermen per-
formed a ritual of ancient origin: on the right 
cheek of the fish some cuts were made to form a 
net of multiple crosses, probably with an apo-tropaic function (i.e. to ward off evil) and to ask 
forgiveness from the opponent who had been 
killed, as it was done in prey-killing rituals during prehistoric times. This ritual is still alive and it is easily visible on the fishes lying on the fishmon-
gers’ counters.THE MATTANZA 
The final act of traditional 
tuna fishing was the  
mattanza (‘slaughter’): singing ancient incanta-tions, the fishermen  
harpoon the tunas with 
their hooks and haul them on board. Ceramic tiles, 18th cent., Trapani."

‘The sea is water and water is memory. 
In the sea the freshwater rivers of  our stories are spilled out.’  
   (V . Cimò)
I’m not a sailor nor a fisherman, and I know 
very little about the sea. Being a good Sicilian  
I don’t talk about it much. It’s a personal thing. 
About the sea we live, we die, or we sing.  
Its animated water has always seduced me. I’m a 
musician and I let the sounds of its salty vibrations 
bewitch me. 
Every sound of the sea has at least one story 
associated with it. When I was a child I already became curious about the stories kept in the memory of my people. The land where I was born is an island enveloped in an embrace, sometimes 
benevolent and sometimes asphyxiating, in which 
the sea gives life and devours it at the same time. This mysterious embrace has so roused the imagi-
nation as to dominate our chronicles — both the 
real and the fantastic ones. The tides stimulate  
the islander’s experience and regulate its rhythm. It doesn’t matter whether you live on the coast  
or inland; you obey the roar of the tide just the 
same, carrying its echo with you wherever you go. Be  ing born on an island conditions the soul, espe-
cially on Sicily. The Trinacria, majestic land of the Folk-tales:

"197FOLK-TALES. MUSICAL STORIES OF PEOPLE AND FISHthree capes, has always been the pride and joy of 
the ethnic groups devoted to the sea. Its maternal 
nature and fertile soil have made it into a dwelling 
place for people from the earliest times. Y et it is essential not to disregard the ‘extravagance’ of this 
land: Sicily, being the greatest island in the Medi-
terranean Sea, is an island sui generis. The Strait of 
Messina, which separates it from the mainland, in 
fact is only a little tongue of brackish water; yet it is also a primordial passage, a crossroads of ethnici-
ties, and the stage of everlasting folk-tales, myths 
and great deeds. An austere lieu de mémoire, dedi-cated by the compositions of gifted songwriters. The two songs that I present here are genuine 
manifestations of it. 
THE LEGEND OF COLAPESCE
As a most able swimmer, the boy Cola devoted 
his life to the sea. His mother, angered by his 
behaviour, cursed him: ‘Sooner or later you will 
become a fish!’ she said, and, by unknown powers, this was in fact brought about. Cola’s body changed; with his scaly skin and webbed hands 
and feet, he became half boy, half fish. Thanks to 
his exceptional qualities, the sea became his home: he explored its seaweed-covered depths 
and knew its nature in secret. He was a fish 
among the fish. During one of his missions for the king, he dis covered that Sicily was held up by 
three pillars, one of which was about to give way: the island was destined to sink into the deep with its inhabitants. Moved to compassion, Cola sacri-ficed himself for his people. He took the place of 
the crumbling pillar, supporting his beloved island  
forever and warding off its tragic end. Since then, 
the boy-fish has remained under water, a prisoner 
of his own choice. Whenever an earthquake is  
felt in the city of Messina, its inhabitants think  
of Cola, who, tired from the effort, changes his 
position to find relief. It is rumoured that the winds sometimes carry his anguished voice,  
echoing on the surface: ‘Majesty! Majesty! I’m here! I’m here!’
La genti lu chiamava Colapiscipirchì stava ‘nta mari comu ‘npiscidunni vinia non lu sapia nissunufors’era figghiu di lu diu Nittunu.People called him ColapesceBecause he stayed in the sea like a fish.
Where he came from, nobody knew;
Perhaps he was a son of the god Neptune. 
The story of Colapesce has distant origins and 
survives in many versions. The song by Otello 
Profazio introduced it to the modern public. Pisci Cola tells the story of a uomo marino or sea-man,  
a protagonist in Mediterranean literature. Familiar 
with the mysteries of the subterranean world, Cola is an entity above part: he doesn’t belong to 
the poor, nor to the sailors, nor to the powerful. 
The boy who walks on the sea floor may be  outside human nature, but he makes the ultimate 
sacrifice for his community. Cola the amphibious 
hero belongs to the water, and in the water his drama unfolds. Between devotion and condemna-tion, the sea element guarantees the narrative  
system’s continuity of time and space. Wanderers 
and writers of every age and country have dealt with the subject, having heard the tale told by  
sailors who unknowingly kept the memory alive. 
The first testimonies go back to the twelfth  century (Raimon Jordan); over forty writers used the story, shaping its content at will. T o cite some 
illustrious examples: Gervase of Tilbury’s Otia 
imperialia (early thirteenth century), Pece Nicolao  by Pedro Mexía (sixteenth century), Friedrich 
Schiller’s ballad Der T aucher (late eighteenth  
century), and Giovanni Pontano’s didactic poem 
Urania (fifteenth century). Of course, Sicilian  dialect versions are known from every region on 
the island, with different and sometimes contra-
dictory endings. Over time the popular stories influenced the written works, while the latter in 
their turn inspired the oral heritage, preserving  
its structural line in any case. The ‘case of the  boy-fish’ is a great example of the mutual impact 
between popular culture and literature. Whether 
he is still instructing sailors on which course to take or lies lifeless in the abyss, Colapesce for cen-turies has been resurfacing in our imagination.

own ending. This story’s protagonist is a fish: the "
"198
There he is! There he is! I saw him! I saw him!
Grab the harpoon, kill him! Kill him! Oh!
On Sicily, fishing for swordfish used to mean 
much more than an activity dictated by survival.  
It was an elaborate microcosm and a complex  
system of activities, in which necessity and poverty 
wove an intricate web of archaic codes with pagan roots. Before the actual fishing, the fisherman was 
required to rigorously observe specific norms and 
parameters. In the first place, he had to consider the position of the planets and the sun. The cruel 
rite furthermore demanded the involvement of 
apotropaic (warding off evil) practices for protec-tion against unexpected threats and to implore the indulgence of the sea (or of the deity or dei-
ties — on Sicily this is still seen in the mattanza, 
tuna fishing); to put a spell on the honoured 
opponent and attract him into the space desig-
nated for the kill. Such propitiatory formulas 
(often incomprehensible) attest to lore of subtle worlds, in which the native idiom preserves  phonemes assumed to derive from Latin and 
Greek:
Mamassu di pajanu.Paletta di pajanu.
Majassu di stignela.Paletta di paenu palè.Palè la stagneta.
Mancata stigneta.
Pro nastu vardu pressu da visu, e da terra.
The fisherman reveres his prey and admires its 
qualities. The act of fishing combines the drama  
of the hunt with the perpetual struggle between 
human beings and the sea. Air against water. The 
act of fishing becomes a mythical encounter be -tween anthropomorphic animal and beast-like man; both vanquishers and vanquished derive 
honour and dignity from the contest. 
The sea equally enchants and horrifies the 
human being. Only the narrative act succeeds in giving consistency to the primeval relationship in 
which man’s ephemeral fickleness encounters the immensity of the living water. Perhaps this is the reason why, in the realm of imagination, a boy 
becomes a fish and a marine animal has human 
emotions.swordfish, a unique creature. No less than its extraordinary appearance, the monogamous nature of this animal captivates people’s imagination Du -ring the summer months, the swordfish (Xiphias 
gladius, see D’Atri’s contribution) lives in the Strait 
of Sicily to join its mate and reproduce amidst  the warm sea currents. Experienced fishermen use 
a cruel trick to catch it which hasn’t changed in 
centuries. First they harpoon the female swordfish, which is slower, so that the male becomes an  easy prey. In the following episode the narrator, a 
courageous male, is the champion of his dramatic  
destiny: without fear he leaps onto the luntro (the 
boat used to catch swordfish), the fortress of his arch-enemy, to meet death together with his mate. 
The heart-breaking incident has reached us in  the form of a song, sung by singer-songwriter 
Domenico Modugno, who learnt it from some 
fishermen near Messina. 
Chista è na storia d’un piscispada — 
Storia d’amuri
Ddà è! Ddà è! Lu vitti! Lu vitti! Lu vitti!
Pigghia la fiocina, Accidilu! Accidilu! Ah!
This is the story of a swordfish — 
A love story.

 ALLARD PIERSON MUSEUM
SICILIË   en de zee 
              en de zeeSicily. Island of myths and monsters, meeting place of cul-
tures, hub of naval trade routes, source of artistic inspira-
tion and of great material wealth, and much-coveted stra-
tegic location in the Mediterranean. Phoenician and 
Greek colonists were the ﬁ  rst outsiders to settle on Sicily and 
enjoy the riches that the sea and the fertile soil brought them.
They were followed by a bewildering variety of invaders over 
the ages: from Romans and Byzantines through Arabs and vari-
ous European dynasties up to the Allies during the Second World War. All these cultures — sometimes living in peace, some-
times at war, always inﬂ  uencing each other — left their traces on 
the island itself and in the sea surrounding it.
Inspired by Sicily’s archaeological and cultural treasures, this 
book offers an overview — or perhaps rather an anthology, since a complete survey, if at all possible, would soon become sti-ﬂ  ing — of the island’s history and culture, paying attention not 
only to ancient and medieval shipwrecks, battles, economy and 
art, but also to typically Sicilian traditions (from folk-tales and tuna ﬁ  shing to maﬁ  a ﬁ  ghters), modern politics, and the poets, 
novelists and ﬁ  lm makers who lived on Sicily or were inspired 
by its unique character.
