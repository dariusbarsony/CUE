"Rome  has always been synonymous with an immense empire  
built on conquest and military power. It is our historical touchstone  
in a political, administrative and military sense, and lies at the  
foundation of our culture. When we think of Rome, we think of  
emperors (preferably mad) and gladiators (usually exotic). But 
what does Rome look like if we try to escape these stereotypes? 
This book wants to show readers a different image of Rome, an  
image characterised first and foremost by the diversity of the  
Roman world. We can only understand that diversity if we study  
the Roman world as a whole – not split into east and west or into 
provinces – and in the context of world history. We will do so by  
looking into seven themes that together offer a comprehensive  
overview in which dynamics and change are the central concepts.  
In order to shed light on the local aspect, we will focus on three  
regions which are Roman in their very own and unmistakeable ways: the Italian peninsula, Egypt, and the Low Countries.
The Roman Empire has many faces. Some of the more important 
ones will be singled out here, creating a kaleidoscopic image of a changing world and a new image of the Roman Empire that will 
help to set rusty views in motion again.

MIX OF STYLESWood, h. 35.6 cm; AD 200-300, Egypt.This portrait of a woman is a fine example of connectivity within the Roman world. The painted mummy portraits from Roman Egypt are of great importance because of the mix of Pharaonic and Hellenistic styles in burial ritual that they represent. They tap into the core of the interaction between the various regions of the Roman Empire.SpO nSO rS

the refurbishment of the Roman 
galleries were subsidised by

The book in front of you is being published to 
mark the refurbishment of the Roman galleries  
of the Allard Pierson Museum, the archaeological 
museum of the University of Amsterdam. T
he 
publication and the exhibition offer a new and intriguing overview of the dynamism and diversity within the Roman Empire. In it the Allard Pierson Museum’s collection, along with archaeological-historical research in the Low Countries, the  
Mediterranean Region and Egypt are illuminated on the basis of a varie
ty of themes that show  
the connectivity within the Roman Empire. T
he refurbished Roman galleries provide a  
foretaste of the complete renovation of the Allard Pierson Museum that will be carried out in the years ahead. T
he visitor can become acquainted 
with digital applications and visualisations of archaeological research and museum displays. This project was made possible through our  
collaboration within the Virtual Museum Trans
-
national Ne
twork (v-must.net) and the interna-
tional network Keys to Rome, both financed  
by the European Union and coordinated by  Sofia Pescarin and Daniël Pletinckx. 
T
his publication has been created through 
inspired collaboration between Olaf Kaper,  
Frits Naerebout, Miguel John Versluys and the undersigned, all members of the editorial team. F
rits Naerebout came up with the Dutch title as 
well as the conceptual layout. Specialists for each region were found who were prepared to eluci -
date seven thematic perspectives in brief chap-
ters. Key objects were identified with respect to 
the themes and the three regions. T
hese, along 
with the other objects were described by the  
team of curators at the Allard Pierson Museum: René van Beek, Branko van Oppen de Ruiter  
and the undersigned. K
eys to Rome is the fifth volume of the Allard 
Pierson Museum Series published in collaboration 
with WBOOKS in Zwolle. The coordination of the publication was organized by Paulien Retèl. The translation into English was by Corinna Vermeulen. The  
project coordinator for the exhibition was  
Marian Schilder, the design of the publication  
was in the hands of Miriam Schlick (Extrablond) who desgned the e
xhibition together with Theo 
Braams Projecten. The steering group was chaired by Steph Scholten, director of UvA Erfgoed. We  
would like to thank all who contributed to the  
creation of the exhibition and this publication.  T
he Keys to Rome project could be completed 
only with the generous support of the Mondriaan Fund, the K.F. Hein Fund, Stichting Charema – Fonds voor Geschiedenis en Kunst, the Amster -
dam  University Fund, the Stichting Steunfonds Allard Pierson Museum, the European Commis-
sion (FP7 2007/2013), Labrys Reizen, Stichting 
Zenobia, and the F
riends of the Allard Pierson 
Museum. Our heartfelt thanks go to these  
generous donors in the knowledge that they in the end have made this project possible toge
ther 
with the University of Amsterdam. By means of this publication and the museum’s refurbishment we are demonstrating that the Allard Pierson Museum is an institute of high standing that has secured for itself a prominent position within the University of Amsterdam, in  
the Netherlands and in Europe. From our building superbly located in the heart of Amsterdam, we say with pride: the Allard Pierson Museum, where arc
haeology meets the future!

Print from glass-plate  
negative, collodion process, 21 x 26.8 cm; attributed to Eugène Constant, 1855 (from a collection of 11 plate negatives by the same  photographer).
A rare view of Rome as it was in 1855, when archaeo-logical research was boom-ing. The temple of Saturn  is in the foreground, the Basilica Julia excavations right behind it. To the left, young trees along the Via Sacra and the Arch of  Titus; the Colosseum is  visible in the distance. Since exposure took sever-al minutes, there are hardly any people in the picture, although they were there  in reality—we only see a  sitting boy and standing horses."

Around 1954 the Leiden archaeologist and  
classicist Frédéric Bastet wrote a magnificent 
Dutc
h sonnet on the famous equestrian statue  
of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, which still stood on the Capitol in Rome then. In the poem he  
contrasts the imperial supremacy: 
 Radiant glor
y after battle won—
 T
he lifted arm, the wide grip of the legs,
 T
he upright body pure in majesty,
 Like a god, he sits astride his horse.
with what we might call the down side of holding 
Rome’s highest office: 
 And ye
t—he holds his grey head bowed, 
 Not liberated, tired, almost invisibly: 
 not just triumphant after victor
y 
 but silently resenting power and sword. In the autumn of 2013 this st
atue filled half a  
page in the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad; the equally famous Ale
xander mosaic from  
Pompeii was visible in the background. But it  
did not illustrate an article pondering Roman 
power as Baste
t’s sonnet does, nor an essay on 
the many images and perceptions of Rome that have so deeply influenced our European culture to this day. Indeed, it did not accompany an article on any aspect of the Roman Empire, but a mere advertisement for a DVD box entitled The Roman Empire. The ad text incited the reader to buy this BBC documentary with the phrase: ‘The Roman Empire created much more than the well-known gladiators, senators, slaves, and chariots.’ The  
person who wrote this sentence must have been thinking of Rome as it is presented in movies suc
h as Ben-Hur, Spartacus and Gladiator.  
Apparently these elements are regarded as  
typical for our image of Rome (that which is  ‘well-known’) and it is thought that without the 
help of the B
BC, even the readers of a high- 
quality newspaper will get no further than that image.fRom R ome

LANDSCAPE WITH 
CLASSICAL RUINS  AND FIGURES
Marco Ricci, Landscape 
with Classical Ruins and Figures, oil on canvas,  h. 161 x w. 123 cm;  c.1725–1730.
Towards the end of his life,  the Italian Baroque painter Marco Ricci specialised in dramatic and picturesque landscapes. This is an  imaginary landscape with ruins from Antiquity. Ricci combined huge monu-ments from different parts of the world: Greek and Roman temples and stat-ues as well as an Egyptian obelisk and pyramid, dwarf-ing the human figures."

Frank Dillon, Sunset on the 
Nile, oil on canvas, h. 33.5  x w. 79.5 cm; c.1855–1870.
Egypt’s age-old, enigmatic  civilisation also became a part of the Roman Empire, thus speeding up the interes-ting exchange between the Mediterranean world and  the country of the Nile. Egypt became Roman, and Rome  in its turn was deeply influ
-
enced by its new province. Egypt’s e
xotic allure was 
masterfully painted by Frank Dillon. The setting sun provi-des dramatic hues, while the smooth surface of the Nile mirrors the palm trees and the silhouettes of the world-famous Gizeh pyramids. The mysterious glory is presented like an intangible mirage. (Greek and Latin)—as if the two are naturally  
connected. 
T
he image of Rome as it has helped determine 
the Western world in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (and still determines it at present) is now complete. Rome lies at the foundation of  
our culture, it is assumed, because just like the nine
teenth- and twentieth-century nation-states 
of Europe and the United States, Rome was  
a successful empire that conquered and  
modernised the world with its superior military  and administrative power. Culturally speaking, 
Rome is moreover seen as a guardian of Greek civilisation and thus (toge
ther with the Renais -
sance) as a crucial link between classical Athens and a modern Europe that has decided to base itself on the cultural values of this Ancient Greece. Rome has added many practical b
onuses 
to the Greek heritage, from Roman law to runnning water and underfloor heating. Its power, its relation to Greece and its creativity have made Rome into the bringer of civilisation—Christianity included—to less fortunate regions. This image  
of Rome as the source of cultural heritage is  
very influential to this day. 
Rome may be our historical touc
hstone in a  
political, administrative and military sense—the United St
ates and Europe see parallels between Perhaps the ad writer is right in assuming that many people never see beyond the legionaries and emperors, the amphitheatre and the races. The subjects of the books by the most popular Dutch historian of Antiquity at this moment, Fik Meijer, in general conform to the same image.  
We may be wronging him a little, but his titles include: 
Emperors Don’t Die In Bed (2001, English 
2004); The Gladiators (2003, English 2004);  
Chariot Racing in the Roman Empire (2004,  
English 2010), and Limitless Power. Rome and  its Empire (2008, no English translation available 
as ye
t). Rome is seen as an empire built on con-
quest and military power, and in the wake of these follow themes like emperors (pre
ferably mad)  
and gladiators (usually exotic). And although there are clear diff
erences between countries in this 
respect, this stereotype view is found outside  
the Netherlands as well.T
here is another widely-spread image of Rome 
that is a bit more sophisticated. It originates  
from a peculiarity of the words ‘Rome’ and ‘Roman’: whenever we say ‘Rome’ and t
alk about 
‘Roman’ culture, we always imply ‘Greek’ at the same time. It is no coincidence that Alexander  
the Great is visible behind Marcus Aurelius in  
the DVD advertisement, nor that we speak of 
‘Graeco-Roman civilisation’ and ‘reading Classics’ "

Rome and themselves all the time—and may be 
viewed as the source of our culture, but what would Rome look like if we tried to escape these stereotypes?
 As specialist scholarly knowledge 
grows, the general public seems to know less  
and less about Rome. The Hollywood image of gladiator fights, c
hariot races and orgies seems  
to have taken over. But Rome is so much more than those f
ew standard elements—and so much 
more than a conduit for Greek culture, too.This book wants to show readers a different image of Rome. An image that, like any other,  
has been determined by the specific circum-
stances attending its emergence; future gene

rations will tr
y to understand Rome in yet other 
ways. Our image of Rome is an image of our 
times: its hallmark is the diversity of the Roman world. It states that we can only understand this diversity if we study the Roman world as a whole, not split into east and west or into provinces, and in the context of world history. We will do so by looking into a number of subjects that together offer an overview that is not exhaustive, but  
definitely comprehensive. 
WHaT  O r WHO  IS  ‘ rOM an’?
In formulating a new image of Rome it immedi-
ately becomes clear how difficult it is to under-stand ‘Rome’ in the terms of the nineteenth- and 
twentie
th-century nation-state which we find so 
obvious. This starts with the name itself. Rome is  
a city that developed into an empire by conquering first the It
alian peninsula and then large parts of 
the known world. This empire had little to do with a nation-state. The view that cultures can be equated with nations, together with a matching  
set of values, is only a few hundred years old.  
That doesn’t mean, of course, that in the age of 
the Roman Empire people could not f
eel Roman. 
They certainly could. But what they took the word to mean and what they felt when they used it is probably quite different from what we usually take it to mean, with our nineteenth- and twentieth-century frame of reference. The Romans them -
selves, at least the members of the upper class, also struggled with the question what ‘Roman’ really meant. Cicero for inst
ance wrote in his  
Laws (c.50 BC): 
All citizens, I think, have two countries: one  
by birth, one by citizenship. (...) It is necessary for the republic to come first in our aff
ection, 
since that is our common country. (...) 
ye
t the 
place where we were born is hardly less beloved than the place that took us in.  
And so I myself will certainly never deny  
that this [Arpinum] is my country, although  
the other one [the republic] is larger and  
contains it.
A good centur
y earlier the author Ennius even 
speaks of three hearts when he wants to name 
his cultural identity. People had local roots (Cicero in Arpinum, Ennius in Rudiae), they were citizens of an ever-growing Roman entity, and they were inhabitants of the wider Hellenistic world—the world of the Aegean and the Near East as it  "

keys to  romeand competed with each other collecting art from 
the Greek world, libraries filled with Greek litera-
ture and philosophy, and cultured slaves. They 
created a lif
estyle inspired by the Hellenistic world 
and had their portraits made in Hellenistic style. But in their interest for all things Hellenistic, they were constantly defining what Roman was; for after all, they did not become Greek, they acted Greek, if and when it suited them. Virgil’s Aeneid is a good example of this: the Roman epic written during the reign of the first emperor, Augustus, tells the story of the Trojan hero Aeneas, founder of Rome. His origins create a connection between Roman and Greek history. It is common knowl -
edge that the Trojans were besieged and had been shaped after Ale
xander the Great’s  
conquests. Through the expansion of the empire people were increasingly conscious of this. It caused a lot of friction. Romans liked to show off their love for Rome’s image as traditional and authentic. Reality
,  
however, was different: Rome was always in  
a state of change, and the changes became  
more frequent and more incisive as the empire 
grew
. Many Late-Republican aristocrats had 
become inhabitants of the Hellenistic world  
in every way; in it they made their military- 
administrative careers and amassed their  fortunes. They familiarised themselves with  the Hellenistic-Greek culture and language  "

THE FALL OF THE  
ROMAN EMPIRE
Film still from The Fall  
of the Roman Empire  (Anthony Mann, 1964).
The glory and grandeur,  the greed and the lust  for power of the Roman Empire already fascinated people in the middle of  the twentieth century, as  is clear from classical ‘epic’ films such as Quo Vadis (1951), Ben-Hur (1959), Spartacus (1960), and Cleopatra (1963). In The  Fall of the Roman Empire—starring Alec Guinness  as Marcus Aurelius and  Sophia Loren as his daugh-ter Lucilla—, the almost  proverbial decadence  under the Emperor Com-modus (played by Christo-pher Plummer) is present-ed as a sign of Rome’s in
 
evitable downfall.THE DIVERSIT y OF THE ROMAN  EMPIRE
social or cultural. Papyri from Egypt dating from 
the Hellenistic and Roman period provide a clear illustration. The word ‘Greek’ in these papyri may be used to indicate an inhabitant of one of the ‘Greek settlements’, or someone belonging to  
a certain tax category; ethnically speaking, they were probably b
oth Egyptians. In a more general 
sense, taking on a ‘Greek’ identity meant showing that one wanted to climb the social ladder or  
preserve a certain status. Sometimes the same person has a Greek name in one source and  
an Egyptian name in the other. One’s identity  
is not a single, clearly defined thing, but rather  
a chameleontic ability. It functions like a garment: 
occasion A requires a diff
erent dress from occa-
sion B. In one context or situation, one should  
do x, while in other situations one can easily do  
y or z. That is not inconsistency, it is moving 
around in a multicultural universe whic
h one 
wants to exploit to the full.This means that the Roman identity exists even less than the Dutch identity. As a consequence, speaking of Rome is misleading if one means more than the city of Rome. It soon leads to  
thinking in terms of a more or less uniform  
Roman culture radiating from Rome or being  consciously spread to other parts of the empire. 
Suc
h an equivocal Roman culture and identity  
did not even exist in the city of Rome: as we  
saw, what is Roman is a matter of negotiation  and adaptation. Different parts of society give  the word different meanings, but so do individuals 
when they bring out the diff
erent aspects of their 
identity. Outside Rome, matters are even more complicated: the entire Roman Empire was Roman, but it comprised a world extending from Scotland to Syria, from the Rhine to the Atlantic coast of Morocco—a great variety of cultures.  
Add to that the fact that not everyone stayed in one place: not only did Roman authorities send soldiers and officials from one end of the empire to the other
, but merchants and adventurers also 
found their way along the infrastructure that the empire itself had created. So that we encounter Syrians at Hadrian’s Wall in Northumbria, and  
Batavians in the Praetorian Guard at Rome.  
At the same time a certain cultural homogenisa-defeated by the Greeks: but now, those Trojans’ 
descendants have de
feated the Greeks. Romans 
are not Greeks; if anything, they are a kind of super-Greeks.The definition of ‘Roman’ was not only determined by a confrontation with ‘Greek’, but as the Romans’ world grew, also with concepts such  
as ‘oriental’, ‘Egyptian’, ‘Celtic’ or ‘Germanic’. The Romans reacted against what they saw elsewhere or appropriated specific parts of those foreign concepts. Incident
ally, after 200 BC the Romans 
were far from alone in defining themselves by shadow-boxing with the concept ‘Greek’; it hap -
pened in large parts of the Mediterranean world.  
It was a common Hellenistic process in Egypt,  
in the numerous kingdoms of northern Africa  and the Levant, and in many regions in Europe, 
specifically southern Europe. T
he aforementioned 
acting Greek is in fact being Hellenistic.Most interesting about this phenomenon is  
the tension between this receptiveness to new things and the (apparently) conser
vative character 
of the call for preserving tradition or returning to old values. Parallels with current problems in the Netherlands—how do we define our own position and identity (the local aspect) in an ever-growing world (the global aspect)?—are obvious here.  
And just as in the Roman situation we see that  
in the Netherlands suggesting a return to a ‘tradi-tional and authentic’ situation is used as a coun-terbalance to the social force of globalisation  processes. In fact it is not a counterbalance,  but an expression of the fact that the world has 
already c
hanged. The only thing is that people 
have not yet learnt to deal with that: regressive  
or conservative voices are part of the process.  
It is along this road, or partly along this road, that 
elements of an e
xisting identity merge with the 
new (and continuously renewing) identity. But  
how can this identity be described in the case  
of the Roman Empire?

A good way to constantly remind ourselves of  
this multicultural tangle while we are interpreting 
‘Rome’ is giving the notion of connectivity a cen-
tral position. The image of Rome as a little village 
that on the banks of the T
iber developed its  
identity on its own until, starting from that unique D
NA we call Roman, it grew to be a superpower—
that image is false. Rome always was a part of  
a bigger world, and definitely so from c.200 BC, when ever
ything was stirred up in the Hellenistic 
world, not least because the Romans conquered large parts of it.Exchange and relations between cultures (in other words: connectivity) existed from the  
Bronze Age and, together with accompanying tion t
akes place, precisely because of the political 
unity, economic integration and migration flows: unity in diversity. Suppose that a soldier was born in Libya and  
is now stationed in Gaul, where a merchant from northern It
aly rouses his interest in the cult of  
the Egyptian goddess Isis, so that the soldier  
then imports an Isis statuette into Britannia when 
his legion is moved there. W
hat then do we call 
this cultural phenomenon when we find the  
figurine in an archaeological context? Libyan? Gallic? It
alian? Egyptian? British? For want of  
a better word, we call the diverse and constantly diversifying world that results ‘Roman’: after all,  
it was an empire that grew from Rome and that 
was governed from Rome, at least originally
. But 
the word ‘Roman’ contains much, much more than just ‘Rome’. It is Libyan, Gallic, Egyptian, and so on, in a big multicultural tangle that is impossible to unravel. The example of the soldier also makes it clear that the sculpture of the Egyptian goddess should not necessarily be associated with a  
person from Egypt, let alone with an Egyptian. ‘Roman’ identity is dynamic; it is being constructed afresh ever
y time from the elements at hand  "

The Egyptian goddess is immediately recognisable by her ostrich-feather crown. In her right hand she probably held a sistrum (ritual rattle), which has  disappeared; in the left  she is holding a sacrificial bowl with fruit. The god-dess’ stance is as classical as her attire: a stola (dress) with a palla (outer garment) over it. However, this hollow bronze statuette was not made in Egypt or Italy, but in the Low Countries. The fact that an Egyptian god-dess in Roman clothes  was worshipped in the Low Countries is a good exam-ple of the spread of new world views.THE DIVERSIT y OF THE ROMAN  EMPIRE
the Romans were surfing a wave, together with 
many others. And although they used it well,  
they did not cause the wave, nor were they 
directly responsible for ever
ything it was to  
set in motion.T
hrough these forms of connectivity that had 
been unknown before, the world was more  
unified than it had ever been. Some scholars  
even argue that the concept of globalisation 
should be used to indicate the degree of con
-
nectivity in the Roman Empire; others condemn  
it as anachronistic. However that may be, this  
connectivity—just like the various kinds of con -
nectivity c
haracterising our more recent history— 
had serious consequences: a complex society 
emerged in a large part of the world. T
his did  
not merely happen in Rome, nor through Rome’s government of its ‘colonies’
. Rome was not central 
in every respect, and it was subject to all kinds of influences as much as it influenced other cultures. The relative importance of a place is determined by its position in a network. There were nodes where everything came together; they often lay  
in the so-called periphery, like Alexandria in Egypt, Antioc
h, Ephesus (now Antakya and Efes in  
Turkey), or Augusta Treverorum (Trier, Germany). T
he Roman world cannot be understood in terms 
of provinces or regions. Especially not if the  
definition of such provinces or regions is linked  
to that of the nineteenth-century nation-state, 
with b
orders that had no meaning whatsoever  
at that time. ‘Gaul’ is not a useful category to study separately
, ‘Gaul’ is the name of a part  
of the world that was connected to other parts  
of the world because it belonged to the Roman 
Empire. T
here certainly was no such thing as  
‘the Roman Netherlands’. This does not mean  
that there were no differences between, say, 
Roman Ale
xandria and Roman London; of course 
there were. But we can only understand those  
differences against the background of the Roman world as a whole. Ideally we should there
fore look 
at everything both locally and globally, that is: on  
a far greater scale, at empire level. Which is e
xactly what we envisage doing in this book.ideas on universalism and multiculturalism,  
were first strengthened by the Persian Empire. Ale
xander the Great and his successors con
-
tinued this conglomerate and the Roman Empire incorporated large parts of this Hellenistic world, then further enlarged it by adding the western Mediterranean and northwest Europe. Meanwhile, at the other end of Eurasia, the Chinese Empire was flourishing and growing, the spheres of  
influence of both empires touching each other. ‘Roman’
, then, meant even more connectivity:  
a safe Mediterranean Sea without pirates,  
long-distance trade, a network of roads, common 
languages (Latin, Greek, Aramaic), a universal system of law
, and so on. 
Rome influenced these developments, but was  
a part and a result of them at the same time.  
In Europe we can illustrate this with all kinds  of crucial social changes during the first century 
B
C. We tend to associate these changes with the 
Roman annexation of the regions concerned, but in fact they often preceded conquest. Both the Romans and the lands they invaded had become part of a much bigger network. In other words:  "

Authors have their own predilections and their own style. We have decided not to smoothe it all out, and to show a diversity that suits the diversity of the general subject. The Roman Empire has innumerable faces, only some of which will be  
singled out here; enough to create a kaleido-
scopic image of a changing world and, we hope,  a new image of the Roman Empire that will help 
to se
t rusty views in motion again, and to make 
people see the Roman collection of the Allard Pierson Museum in a new light.neither as individual provinces, nor as centre (Rome and Italy) versus periphery (Egypt and  
the Low Countries). This book studies them in relation to eac
h other, and an equal relation at 
that: as Roman, against the background of the central concepts of change and diversity. For this purpose we have chosen seven themes with a common denominator, which is ‘connectivity of people, animals, plants, goods and ideas’. The collection of the Allard Pierson Museum was our guideline in choosing the regions and themes. While this introduction tries to characterise the diversity of the Roman world in the context of world history in general, the following chapters will illustrate this subject by looking at objects from the Allard Pierson Museum. That means  
that this book in a sense gives a somewhat  
arbitrary overview of the Roman world, but it  will be reasonably complete nonetheless.

in terms of change. Change in the context of  
the Roman Empire is a central theme in all the contributions—some

more implicitly. The themes are: "

THE rOMan arMY
Rome didn’t have a prof
es-
sional army until c.100 BC. 
From that moment, the  soldiers were better-trained and had better weaponry. They carried quite a load: not just their armour, but often tools and food for three days as well. The men in this photo represent legionaries of the Twenty-First Rapax, a legion estab-lished in 31 BC that in AD 70 took part in crushing  the Batavian Revolt.The roman Empire was a world of increasing 
connectivity: the various r
egions of the 
Mediterranean and of north-western Europe 
came into closer contact with each other  
than ever before. The roman army had an 
import
ant part in this, and its campaigns  
can in fact be regarded as one of the first migrations that wer
e set in motion within  
the empire. With the arrival of the army, an infrastructur
e grew until it covered the whole 
empire, from the south of Egypt up to Scot -
land. at first the soldiers came as conquerors, 
but soon loc
als were enlisted, and the recruits 
in their turn were sent to other parts of the empire. The line between conqueror and conquered did not take long to fade. Soldiers also became part of the local community, as we can see from their marrying local women, for instance.In this way the army mirrored a development that was going on throughout the empire.  
The growth of political and economic unity, symb
olised by the system of 
r
oman roads 
around a 
r
oman inland sea—Mare Nostrum, 
Our Sea, as they called the Mediterranean—made an extraordinary mobility possible.  
and that is what we see. Batavians served  
as body guards to the emperor in rome; 
Syrian mer
chants lived near Hadrian’s Wall  
in northumbria. Because of this mobility  
of people from the whole empire, the line between what could be c
alled ‘
r
oman’ and 
what ‘native’ faded rapidly. There was a remarkable demographic development as well: urbanisation soared.

cities were, for the first time, cosmopolitan metropolises such as

the Italian mainland had approximately 11.5  million inhabitants. After the plague epidemics  of 1348—1350, the Black Death, this number fell  to about 7 million. But how many people were  living in Italy when the Carthaginian general  Hannibal invaded the country in 218 BC? Or  
at the beginning of the Imperial Age? These 
questions may not seem ver
y interesting at  
first sight, but at a closer look they turn out  
to be important. If Roman Italy was densely  populated, it must have had a highly developed 
economy—perhaps even more advanced than  
during the Renaissance. Can we verify this 
assumption? Another aspect comes to the fore  
in countless publications stating that Roman Italy, 
especially during the Republic, had a strongly  
militaristic character. An important argument for 
this view is that Rome could muster huge armies during the wars from the late third to the late  
first century BC. In 212 BC, for instance, more than 100,000 Roman citizens ser
ved in the legions 
or in the navy. Supposing that Italy had as many inhabitants then as it had in the early fourteenth century, this effort would have been easy to make. With a much smaller population, however, it would have been a supreme effort.

For the period of 300 BC to AD 100 we have  
a reasonable amount of quantitative data at  our disposal. Unfortunately, most of it is not very 
use
ful. A good example is the Republican census 
data. During the third and second centuries BC, the censores (officials responsible for the census) usually registered approximately 300,000 citizens. In all likelihood this was the number of adult men with Roman citizenship, in other words: the num -
ber of men who could be drafted into the legions. But was this merely
, or mostly, a registration of those men who had enough property to be allowed to serve in the legions, or were the  
proletarii (the free poor, whose only wealth was their offspring or 
proles) also counted, who could 
only be drafted into the navy? Apart from these uncertainties, the census data only regard the inhabitants of those parts of Italy that were  
inhabited by Roman citizens. These areas took  
up about a third of Italy south of the Po River.  
It was not until 90—87 BC that all free inhabitants 
of It
aly south of the Po were given Roman citizen-
ship; those who lived between the Po and the Alps were not promoted to citizenship until 4
9 BC."

minia (Flaminius’ road) 
 
and the Via Salaria (the salt 
road), the Via Appia (Appi-us’ road) is one of the most important roads of ancient Rome. It was constructed to facilitate speedy troop movements, but acquired an enormous economic  importance as well, be-cause it was used for transport of people and goods between Rome and Campania (and beyond). The original trajectory can still be followed reasonably clearly on a modern Italian road map.PEOPLE  AND  MOBILIT y
The most useful piece of information comes from 
the Emperor Augustus’ Res gestae (Deeds). In  
it we read that at the census of the year 28 BC 
4,0
63,000 Roman citizens were registered. Since 
all free inhabitants of Italy had citizenship at that moment, this number seems to be a good starting point for an estimate of the total population. Upon closer examination, it can be interpreted in several ways. According to some scholars Augustus (who was still called Octavian at that time) counted only adult men, as the censores of the Republic had done. In that case we should multiply the number of 4,063,000 with a factor of at least 3.3 to arrive at an estimate of the total population including women and children. If we take slaves and for -
eigners into account as well, we are looking at  
15 to 16 million people. This would mean that the 
It
alian mainland had more inhabitants in Augus-tus’ time than at any later moment before the nine
teenth century.
Most historians of Antiquity are not prepared  
to accept this outcome. There is another problem  
as well: at the census of 70—69 BC some 900,000 
citizens were counted. As we have seen, all free inhabit
ants of Italy south of the Po had citizenship 
at that time. How then can we explain the jump  
to 4 million? The only solution seems to be that the census outcome of 28 B
C includes citizens’ 
wives and children. In that case Italy was inhabited by approximately 4 million people in the class of citizens, while the total population, including slaves and foreigners, came to about 6 million.Attempts to reconstruct the development of the population between 300 BC and AD 100 encoun -
ter even bigger problems than that of determining the size of the population at one given moment.  "

The increase in population coincided with a  
rapid expansion of the cities. At the beginning  of the second century BC the inhabitants of 
Rome probably numbered c.150,000. T
wo hundred 
years later their number had grown to around  
1 million. Before the year 1800, no city in Europe could matc
h this. From the late second century 
BC onward, population growth in many other  
cities accelerated as well. The population of Capua, second city of Roman It
aly, is estimated  
at 40,000 to 50,000. When Vesuvius erupted  
in AD 79, Pompeii had approximately 12,000 
inhabit
ants. At the beginning of the Imperial  
Age that number in all likelihood was far lower.T
he situation in northern Italy is a story apart. 
Developments in this region were in full swing  
in the early Imperial Age. Here Patavium (present-day P
adua), Altinum (Altino) and Mediolanum 
(Milan) were the biggest cities, measuring 130,  
120 and 80 hectares respectively. At first sight these seem considerable numbers, but if we  In fact the only lead is the statement by the Greek historian P
olybius (203—120 BC) that the Romans 
and their allies (south of the Po) could muster about 770,000 soldiers in 225 BC. Starting from this number, it has been calculated that the Italian mainland including the region north of the Po must have had around 4.2 million inhabitants in the third quarter of the third century BC. Slaves are included in this estimate. Some parts of the calculation are a little shaky, but it seems that the Italian population was growing during the last two centuries BC. Archaeological data point in the same direction, specifically the increasing number of farms—a trend that continued during the early Imperial Age. As a consequence Roman Italy may have had as many as 7 or 8 million inhabitants c.100 BC. We should keep in mind, though, that population growth is not the same as a rising free population, since a spectacular increase in the number of slaves is seen over the last centuries BC. Around 28 BC slaves constituted at least  
a quarter of the total population of Italy. "

Outside the walls of Rome, 
the Via Appia is graced by many tombs. The inscrip-tion on this one tells us  that it was made for Her-modorus, freedman of  Gaius Rabirius Postumus, his wife, Rabiria Demaris, and their daughter Usia Prima, priestess of Isis. Usia is depicted with a  sistrum (ritual rattle) and sacrificial bowl, attributes  of the Isis cult. Rabirius Postumus was an ill- reputed businessman  and banker, who had  been Minister of Finance (dioiketes) in Egypt from  55 to 54 BC. King Ptolemy XII Auletes (‘the Flautist’) had him imprisoned for blackmail, but he escaped to Rome and was acquitted there, thanks to his advo-cate Cicero. Hermodorus and Demaris probably came to Rome with  Rabirius.PEOPLE  AND  MOBILIT y

Egypt and Africa the degree of urbanisation  
in Roman Italy could rise above ‘normal’ pre-
industrial levels. T
he dynamics of demography in the metropolis 
Rome—the city itself and the surrounding urban area—deserve special attention. Information from various sources tells us that the population of Rome consisted of approximately 600,000 Roman citizens (women and children included), 200,000 to 300,000 slaves, and around 50,000 foreigners. This leads to the aforementioned estimate of  
1 million inhabitants. Studies of other pre-industrial socie
ties have 
shown that big cities often were hotbeds of  
contagious disease. It was in part because of  
diseases that the death rate was higher than  the birth rate in these cities. Was that the case  in ancient Rome as well? In certain aspects the 
living conditions in Rome were e
xceptionally  
good, at least by pre-industrial standards.  
Obvious examples include the excellent water t

tion they turn out to be rather meagre. We know, 
for inst
ance, that at the beginning of the sixteenth 
century the four largest cities of northern Italy—Milan, Venice, Padua and Bologna—covered areas of 800, 600, 450 and 420 hectares successively. That means that at this time the big cities of northern Italy took up five to six times the area  
of their counterparts in the early Imperial Age. T
his corresponds with the interpretation of the 
census outcome of 28 BC that was argued above. There were around 430 cities in Italy in Augustus’ time. It should be noted that these were cities in the legal sense of the word: some of them merely measured 1 hectare and probably had no more than 150 to 200 inhabitants. But even if we limit ourselves to cities with a population of at least 3,000, we still arrive at a number of 1.6 million  
people living in cities: over a quarter of Italy’s total population. F

T
he forced migration of slaves who were traded 
and of soldiers and civil officials who were posted abroad took on enormous proportions. The fact that a quarter of Italy’s population consisted of slaves speaks volumes. For Rome itself, the part of slaves in the city’s populace has even been estimated at 40 per cent. In Augustus’ time there were about 330,000  
soldiers: 150,000 legionaries, the rest auxiliaries. T
he legionaries were Roman citizens, a vast 
majority of them Italians, at the outset in any  
case; this makes it clear that there was not only an influx of foreigners into It

of Italians going abroad. Part of this emigration was voluntary: we also find Italian merchants spreading over the empire.supply and the monthly distribution of double  
portions of grain to 200,000 inhabitants of the capit

inscriptions stating the date of death that urban mortality reached its peak in late summer and early autumn. This pattern indicates that many deaths were caused by malaria in combination with other contagious diseases, such as gastro-intestinal infections and airway diseases. This makes it highly likely that the death rate exceeded the birth rate in ancient Rome as well. The  
demographic gap left by the excess mortality could partly be filled by importing slaves. But Rome also attracted free immigrants in great numbers, b
oth from Italy and from abroad. Without 
this permanent influx of newcomers Rome would not have been able to maintain the size it had reached at the beginning of the Imperial Age. "

This bronze helmet is almost semispheri-
cal, with a protruding neck guard at the 
bac
k. The knob on top has been lost.  
The helmet’s exact provenance is unknown, but the patina indicates that  
it was not found in a river and may have 
been a burial gift. T
he helmet is of the Montefortino-Rieti 
type—named after sites in Italy—, which can be dated to the first century BC; it  
is quite similar to the Mannheim/Coolus A–B type, whic
h can be dated between 
75 and 25 BC. Helmets of these types are usually found without cheek plates, but it is thought that they did have them. Helmets of the general Montefortino type were worn by Roman infantrymen from the third century BC to the first century AD. At the back, the rim has a simple deco
-
ration of flowing lines called the ‘running dog’
. The slightly bulbous rim has so-
called horizontal rope engravings at the front and sides. There are two bronze  
rivets in each side which served to attach a c
heek piece, or a ring for a chin strap. 
At the front, two horizontal lines have been carved above the decorated rim; some letters are visible between them. The two outer characters are embossed rows of dots, the middle one was carved in. Perhaps the middle character was written first and the other two added later. The script is probably north-eastern Iberian (also known as Levantine  
Iberian), which is read from left to right.  
It occurs in the region running from  Jaén (south-east Spain) along the  Alicante coast to Languedoc-Roussillon 
in southern F
rance, and was used until 
the middle of the first century BC. The three characters represent the  
name be–ko–n, which is found repeat-edly in this script. Iberian names are  
usually composite, but single names  do occur. Bekon probably was the first 
name of the helme
t’s owner. 
In the first century BC, Roman foot
-
soldiers were usually called up for short campaigns, after whic
h they returned to 
their civilian lives. This practice changed under Augustus, when the military was professionalised and soldiers were  
stationed in permanent camps for longer periods. T
he way soldiers treated their  
kit changed accordingly: in the first and second centuries AD, they often le
ft their 
marks on helmets, shield bosses or spears, something that was hardly ever done before.The inscription in Iberian script and the name indicate that legionary Bekon was from one of the Spanish provinces. We know that Julius Caesar as governor of Hispania Ulterior (southern Spain) put together a legion there (the Tenth) in  
61 BC. It was to be one of the legions  
he used to conquer Gaul and Britain. 
Caesar disbanded the T
enth in 45 BC; 
the veterans were given land and farms in the south of France and Spain. On account of the model and the Iberian inscription, the helmet must date from the middle of the first century BC; that means that it could have been worn  
by one of Caesar’s legionaries.

The first Roman soldiers helped Ptolemy XII 
ascend the throne in 55 BC; seven years later, they did the same for his daughter Cleopatra VII. Cleopatra in her turn offered lodging to Mark Antony’s soldiers. After Octavian (who was to become the Emperor Augustus) had defeated them both in 30 BC, he stationed three legions  
in Egypt: one in Alexandria, one in Babylon  
(a fortress in what is now Coptic Cairo), and  one in Thebes (present-day Luxor). Those legions, 
appro
ximately 16,500 men in all, mainly originated 
from Italy. In addition, the auxiliaries numbered c.6,000, sometimes operating independently in cohorts of 500 men infantry (9 cohorts) or cavalry (3 cohorts). They were not Romans, at least not yet: the auxiliaries originated from other parts  
of the Roman Empire.Suc
h a large occupying force soon turned out  
to be unnecessary. Egypt became a Roman  
province and the number of legions was reduced 
to two; they were b
oth stationed at Nicopolis near 
Alexandria. From occupiers the soldiers became border guards, police officers in unruly Alexandria, and supervisors at the state mines in the Eastern Desert. Only rarely were they needed elsewhere in Egypt, since there were few uprisings—the Jewish Revolt of AD 115—117 being a remarkable exception. Sometimes legions were dispatched  
to other provinces to stamp out revolts there,  
for instance the revolt in Judaea in AD 132—135. 
A
fter that, only one legion was left in Nicopolis. 
The number of auxiliaries, on the other hand, increased somewhat; as a result there still was  
a total of 12,000 soldiers in the middle of the third centur
y AD. In late Antiquity, from the fourth  
century onward, legions in Egypt were more numerous but smaller
. ‘Barbarian’ cohorts from 
outside the borders of the empire were also  
introduced.a prOFESSIO naL arMY  
Recruits usually ended up in a different province from their own, but from the second century AD inhabitants of Egypt could serve in Egypt itself. Every free man could enlist in an auxiliary cohort or in the navy, but people from the cities, who were collectively regarded as ‘Greeks’ in Egypt, could enlist in a legion. Legions consisted solely of Roman citizens, so that the ‘Greeks’ upon enlistment had to become Roman citizens. Legionaries had to serve for twenty years. The rest of the Egyptians, that is to say the villagers who served as auxiliaries and in the navy, didn’t acquire Roman citizenship until the end of their service after twenty-five years.Serving in the army therefore was a profession. Veterans by definition were rather old, because  
no one was enlisted under eighteen; the oldest known recruit, Aurelius Sabius, was thirty-four years of age, according to a gravestone inscrip -
tion from Nicopolis. Soldiers who had served  
for twenty or twenty-five years respectively  were not obliged to leave the army. According  to his grave inscription Menodorus, son of  Hermogenes, served for forty-two years as a 
common soldier; elsewhere in the Roman Empire centurions (officers commanding eighty men) ser
ved even longer, until they were sixty-one.  
In any case, not everyone lived to see the end  
of his service. We know veterans mostly thanks  to papyrus files from Philadelphia and Karanis, 
two towns in the F
ayyum. Most of the files were 
written in Greek—as personal files usually were  
in Roman Egypt—but some of the texts are in Latin. T
he Latin texts are official documents  
confirming the status of the veterans as Roman citizens, and le
tters from comrades.
What army life was like in Egypt we know partly from sources that we have for other provinces  
as well (inscriptions, archaeology), partly from files written on papyrus. T
hey include Greek texts, but 
most were written in Latin: the official language  
of the military administration. In the legions sol-
diers often learnt to read and write Latin, but  most of the soldiers from the eastern provinces, 
including Egypt, were more familiar with Greek. T

THE MILIT arY  In THE  Ea STEr n D ESE r T
In strategic locations in Egypt’s Eastern Desert, the Roman army had built guard posts, strong points and forts, in which small garrisons were stationed. Protecting the mines and quarries of the Eastern Desert (which yielded stones such  
as porphyry, granodiorite and emerald) was  
important to the Romans, as was guarding the 
Red S
ea ports and the maritime trade with  
eastern Africa, Arabia and India. Because of the ric
h spoils to be won, the ports were constantly 
threatened by robbers and enemy tribes from the desert, such as the Blemmyes and the Nobadae. The Roman forts in the Eastern Desert mostly  
had a rectangular plan, with towers at the corners. In the bigger fortresses, e.g. that of Mons Claudi-
anus, towers were often added along the walls,  
as well as stairs or ramps leading to the battle-ments from inside. The walls had an average 
height of 4 to 5 me
tres (c.13 to c.16.5 feet) and 
were usually built from unhewn boulders and rocks from the wadis (dry river beds) and moun -
tains in the vicinity. Only a few key elements of the building—posts, lintel and threshold—were made of hewn stone. A good e
xample of a smaller desert fort is the  
one excavated at Siket, a few miles northwest  
of the vital port of Berenice. According to a Latin 
inscription, this little 
praesidium was built in the 
ninth year of Vespasian’s reign: AD 76/77. It  
protected a well (hydreuma) that supplied Beren-
ice with water, while also serving as a guard post 
on the route to the north and the cities on the banks of the Nile. T
he fort, which probably housed 
no more than ten soldiers at a time, measured about 24 by 32 metres (c.80 by c.105 feet) and had a tower at every corner.Not only the area north of Berenice had to be guarded, but the south as well: from that direction the Blemmyes and the Nobadae used to attack the passing caravans. For this purpose a huge in AD 179 got his receipts from an auxiliary  
cohort in Greek. A third of them was written by the recipients themselves, the rest by someone who helped them. S
oldiers received the same pay everywhere,  
and because of the low cost of living in Egypt they had a good lif
e there. Thanks to the end- 
of-service bonus, veterans could look forward  
to a comfortable old age. We know the well-to-do 
ve
terans from Egypt from a number of personal 
files on papyrus, such as that of Lucius Bellienus Gemellus. According to correspondence with his representative in Euhemeria in the Fayyum he  
ran a farm and had a family; in AD 110 he was  
seventy-eight years old. His service gave him  
his Roman triple name and reasonable means;  
he also celebrated the Saturnalia, the Roman  version of carnival.
Although under Augustus soldiers were no longer allowed to marr
y, they did enter lasting relation -
ships. Since they usually served in a different province from that of their birth, most of the  
soldiers’ partners were foreign women. In Egypt, 
the soldiers took Egyptian partners. T
he phenom-
enon was not unheard of, for after the conquest by Ale
xander the Great, many Greek soldiers  
had likewise married Egyptian women. The Roman soldiers had to make sure that their  
children acquired Roman citizenship. For the 
legionaries this wasn’t difficult, since they already were citizens themselves. T
he relationship with 
their ‘concubines’, tolerated but unofficial, could be normalised later; so could the status of their children. Their sons could easily obtain Roman  
citizenship in any case: by enlisting. An inscription from AD 194 tells us that this was a common occurrence. Out of the 41 ve
terans it mentions 
from a legion in Nicopolis, no less than 32 origi -
nated from Egypt: a few from Alexandria, but  
most of them (24) from the fort itself. It was  not until over two hundred years later that the 
Emperor S
eptimius Severus lifted Augustus’  
ban on soldiers’ marriage. Earlier in the second centur
y, the Emperor Hadrian had already eased 
inheritance law for soldiers. The army was a

Eastern Desert, the re-mains of a Roman army camp have been discov-ered. The quarry supplied building materials to the entire Roman Empire. It was guarded by the army to secury stone transport through the Nile Valley. Granodiorite from the Mons Claudianus quarry was used in the Pantheon at Rome, Hadrian’s villa in Tibur (now Tivoli, Italy),  and Diocletian’s palace in Spalatum (Split, Croatia).

and a successful one at that. The administration from the local customs office that was e

he names in the text are of particular 
interest. Drakon, possibly the cavalry commander, has a traditional Greek name. Areianos is a less common Greek name, a variant of Arrianos. Isidorus and Petosiris are popular Egyptian names, referring to Isis and Osiris. Clemens and Maximus, though nicknames in origin,  
are common Roman first names.  
Munatianus, on the other hand, is so 
e
xceptional that the name occurs in half 
a dozen Egyptian documents at the most. This first name must have been formed for a freed slave from the Munatius  family. So soldiers with Greek, Egyptian and Roman names ser

in this fort in Egypt.In 19
68, the Allard Pierson Museum  
separately acquired a number of sherds whic

the following decades, new sherds  
were discovered in other collections,  in the Netherlands as well as abroad. 
T
hanks to the efforts of the papyrolo-
gists Willy Clarysse and Pieter Sijpesteijn most of the vase was restored and the te

is lined with bitumen, which is not unu-
sual but made it easier to find fragments 
that belonged to the same document. T
he shape turned out to be that of a 
pithos or elongated amphora. It was  
discovered that one and the same dealer sold the sherds to diff
erent buyers, giving 
a different provenance every time—we may assume that he found the vase intact and broke it with a view to a higher profit on the sherds than on the whole vase.This reused pithos (which the soldiers  
no doubt used as a wine jug first)  
probably stood somewhere in the fort  to make the soldiers’ roster visible to  all. Papyrus was too expensive for this 
purpose. T
he number of grammar and 
spelling errors in the text is striking. Reading and writing were rare skills in Antiquity, but most of the soldiers must have been able to recognise their own name and duty.

relatively large numbers

This means that many young men left their farms to serve along the borders  of the Roman Empire: along Hadrian’s Wall in Northumbria and in pre-sent-day Germany, Hunga-ry, Romania, and Austria. They usually returned to the Batavian countryside after their term of service, as proven by many military artefacts that have been discovered.

In the first and second centuries AD, the Roman 
society in the Low Countries was subject to change in many areas: religious expression,  
material culture, burial rituals, architecture,  
economy. But, we may ask, was central burial  of the dead in the Batavian countryside some-thing that started under the influence of Roman 
culture, or was it in fact a local reaction meant to increase the sense of community? And what kind of impact did the presence of the Roman milit
ary 
have? These are difficult questions that historians of Antiquity and archaeologists have not been asking for very long, and that we are still trying  
to answer.S
cholars have long assumed that in the province 
of Germania Inferior there was a clear-cut  
contrast between native and ‘Roman’ ways and cultural values. T
his cliché view, however, has 
taken a beating over the last years, because we have increasingly taken dynamics and reciprocal influence into consideration. The new approach does more justice to what Rome’s religious and cultural imperialism meant for local communities. Local identities were under high pressure and were changing continuously—which is why mutual influence probably occurred between these identi -
ties and the values that from the central authority of the Roman Empire seeped through to the countr
yside of a border province on the Rhine.

Caesar’s conquest of northern Gaul and the south of the Low Countries hardly left any archaeologi-cal traces.

or Ubian by birth (natione Batavus, natione Ubius). 
What can we learn from these few gravestones? In the first place, that the partial annexation of  
the Low Countries immediately caused an increased mobility
. The first and largest group 
consisted of soldiers, with merchants following  
in their wake, as well as people who wanted to  
try their luck elsewhere. They all brought their 
own cultures with them, but also st
arted to copy 
all sorts of customs from each other and from  
the natives of their new home. Soon it was very difficult to distinguish ‘Roman’ from ‘Germanic’
. 
Gravestones were scarce in the Low Countries  
at that time, except in the vicinity of Roman forts. T
hese stones, however, were not exact copies  
of examples from Rome or Italy, but were devel-
oped in workshops set up to serve a new clientele 
in garrison towns and cities. Regardless if the deceased originated from Rome, elsewhere in It
aly, from Spain, Gaul or Germania: if a monument 
was erected to him or her, it would have the shape that was usual in the Rhine region. In the first century AD that would have been a stela, often with a relief depicting the deceased. A gravestone found in Neuss (Germany) that  
was erected for a Ubian woman named Louba (see p. 111) shows that the increased mobility  
also meant that ethnic groups were no longer 
closed to others, but opened up to allow mixed marriages. P
recisely these mixed marriages were ties (the Condrusi and the Paemani merged  
into the Tungri) and the more or less forced  
immigration of new groups (Batavians and  Ubians) caused a political landslide. The main  historical line however is one of continuity of  habitation. In general, members of the local  communities were proud of their roots. In any 
case, that is the message we can read on many grave monuments in whic
h those who stayed 
behind revealed some of the background of  
the deceased in words and images, especially  
if they were buried outside their country of birth. 
T
he Batavian horsemen for instance who served 
in the mounted personal guard of the Emperors Claudius and Nero had their own graves. Together with other colleagues from Germania, they had founded a collegium Germanorum which main -
tained at least two cemeteries at the outskirts  
of Rome, offering a final resting-place to its  
members. These Germans’ gravestones are  different from the usual monuments to soldiers  in the Low Countries for that period, but show  a close similarity to monuments for soldiers from 
other units in Rome, suc
h as the cohortes urbanae 
(city cohorts) and the cohortes praetoriae (Praeto -
rian Guard), which may have served as an exam-
ple to the mounted imperial guards. All these 
groups probably ordered their gravestones from the same workshops. T

Military objects found in graves and settlements  
in the Batavian countryside give us an idea of  the social use of these objects by veterans. They 
probably were personal memorabilia with a high symb
olic value, reminders of past valour. This 
makes an important change visible. Before the Batavian Revolt of AD 69/70, soldiers upon their return to the civilian world had ritually deposited their armour in a stream or a place of worship. After the first century however more and more military gear turns up in settlements and graves. Apparently parts of the equipment were visibly present in the veterans’ homes, so that they  
were real factors in rural communities.Burial rituals mirror the increasing regional  
differences between the settlements. In Germania

 rectangular grave monuments, 
10—15 metres (33—50 feet) high, mostly along  
the Rhine and in the loess area between Cologne and T

mounds; mostly in the loess area, a few scattered mounds elsewhere) and tombs with stone sar

In the Batavian countryside there were more  
central burials during the Roman period than 
there had been be

question whether this happened under the  
influence of Roman culture or as a native,  local reaction meant to heighten the sense  of community in an ever-growing empire.
T
he burial ritual in the Maas-Demer-Scheldt  
area, a large rural region, shows a strong con -
tinuity in native interment customs. Grave  
construction and the way in which the deceased 
were buried had hardly c

Iron Age, or only very slowly. As a consequence, no Roman influence to speak of can be seen  
in the burial ritual, apart from the use of Roman potter

The few Roman objects that have been found  
in graves, such as grinding bowls (mortaria) and plates, mostly seem to show that eating customs were being copied. In ver

This nearly ten-metre-high 
Jupiter column stood in the Roman settlement at what is now Maastricht (the Netherlands). Part of the base was found in 1983, while several fragments of Jupiter columns discovered in the pillars of the Roman Maas bridge have been used in this reconstruction. The column had several levels with a niche contain-ing the statue of a god on each side. An excavated fragment of a niche con-tained a piece of a globe and a ship’s helm. Both were attributes of the god-dess Fortuna. On top of the column was a more than ‘life-size’ statue of Jupiter with an eagle.
cOncLUSIO n
A relatively small group of city administrators,  
villa owners, soldiers and veterans was closest  to the Roman military and civil authorities, and  can be regarded as the local elite. The question 
as to what Roman imperialism meant for this group on a local level was answered in clic
hé 
terms until recently: the upper class was  
Romanised to a higher degree, the native farmers accordingly less so. However
, local communities 
were constantly changing under the influence  
of a multicultural dialogue with the global values whic
h from the central authoritiy in Rome were 
seeping through to the countries along the Rhine. Whenever an individual or a group participated in the administration of the civitas, or a man enlisted in the army, the identity of the local community was under pressure. Indications of ethnicity in inscriptions, burials, dedications and material  
culture in general illustrate that interaction. buried in a diff
erent way (that we cannot trace 
archaeologicaly), since no monumental tombs have been found there. Pillar tombs and enclosed cemeteries survive along the Rhine, both along its lower course  
and farther to the south. The enclosed cemetery found at Nijmegen-W
est in the Netherlands 
clearly shows how this elite wanted to shape  
its own identity by mixing Batavian and Roman elements. T
he weaponry and a Germanic trumpet 
brooch (fibula) that were included in the burial gifts, and the wooden chamber illustrate the  
Batavian roots of the deceased. The pillar tomb, on the other hand, is a Mediterranean element,  
as are the amber objects and a twelve-piece set 
of 
terra sigillata crockery. It is significant that the 
practice of placing a complete set of tableware  
in the tomb is unknown in Italy; it belongs to  
the local or regional burial customs. This private 
ceme
tery of the Batavian elite makes it abun-
dantly clear that Roman imperial values and  
local tradition were being mixed. 
T
he Jupiter columns exemplify the ambiguous 
position of the new upper class. These columns were mostly erected from the late second century onward, in military as well as civilian contexts.  
On top of the column was a statue of Jupiter,  
the Roman supreme god. The connection that  
is often made with the state religion seems 
unwarranted. Around AD 150, when consecrations to Jupiter were plumme
ting in Rome, they sud -
denly showed a strong increase in the provinces along the Rhine. Moreover
, dedications to Jupiter 
are hardly ever found outside of the two Germanic provinces and Raetia. In all likelihood the conse -
crations to Jupiter were mainly made by native donors: the columns are usually found near  
homesteads built from stone (villae) and sanc
-
tuaries related to them as e
xpressions of local 
religious custom. Despite their impressive looks 
they should not be seen as official or public, but rather as private dedications. Furthermore they illustrate that form (the Roman supreme god)  
and content (local significance and donors)  
could be parallel worlds. "

At military parades, Roman soldiers and 
officers showed off their parade armour instead of wearing their usual fighting gear. This sumptuously adorned bronze cavalry helmet was meant for such  
occasions. It has recesses for the ears and a cur
ved neck guard. Originally it 
may have come with a bronze (silver-  
or gold-plated) mask that was attached to it using the holes le
ft and right on the 
rim. The helmet must have shone brightly when it caught the sun; a hole in the top indicates that it was decorated with a crest. This helmet belongs to the so-called Weiler/Guisborough type, which in the second half of the first and in the second century AD was made mostly in bronze plating, and which was always decorated with figurative and animal motifs in repoussé technique. This decorative  
type of helmet originated in the Greek eastern part of the Roman Empire, as opposed to the It
alian and Gallic  
helmets from earlier periods.T
his parade helmet with a green patina 
has been ornamented with delicate repoussé work on all sides. The rim  
is adorned with a band of rosettes at  
the front and a cable pattern at the back.

into the neck guard, part cut and part repoussé. Both sides of the helme

decorated with a relief depicting a boy riding a dolphin on the waves of the sea. The winged boy is holding the reins around the dolphin’s neck in one hand.

with Roman soldiers. The front of the helmet is ornamented with a male bust. The face is turned  
to the right and encircled with curls and a full beard. Over his winged shoulders, he is wearing a lion’s skin that is knotted over his c
hest. Its claws are grabbing  
a bolt of lightning. This bust of a god—with wings, b
olt of lightning, lion’s skin 
and claws—represents Zeus or Jupiter  
in a different way from what is normal  
in classical art. It is rather an identifica-tion of the Roman Jupiter with a Celtic  or Germanic god of thunder, such as Donar (also known as T
hor). Donar is  
a kind of fusion god who can be identi-fied with the Roman supreme god  Jupiter, but also with the heroic Hercules. 
Judging from the patina, the helme

must have been found in a river bed  
in Germania Inferior; it must have had  a representative purpose in military 
parades. It was doubtless made locally—whic
h is confirmed by the iconography.

The impact of Roman expansion on the economy 
of the Italian peninsula was different in nature from that on Roman conquests elsewhere in the Mediterranean and Europe, where one might speak of a ‘globalisation process’. In Italy things were different for two reasons. The first is that before the rise of Rome, Italy was already highly integrated into Mediterranean economic networks. The Greek poleis (city-states) in southern Italy from their beginnings maintained close ties with the Aegean and conducted intensive trade with the urban centres of Etruria. Perhaps Rome’s ascendancy would even have been impossible without these economic networks. The second reason is that, from the late Republic onward in any case, the most important driving force behind economic change in Roman Italy was the expo -
nential growth of the city of Rome and the increasing demand for consumer goods that
 
accompanied it, rather than Italy’s integration into a larger geographic entity. In other words, large parts of the Italian peninsula turned into the  
‘surrounding countryside’ of the Roman market. F
rom an economic point of view, the ‘unification’ 
of Italy during the third and second centuries  
BC primarily consisted in ever larger parts of  the peninsula being connected to an economy  
dominated by the Roman metropolis. In this  
system more and more roads led to Rome, while more and more ports concentrated on catering
  
to the needs of the city on the Tiber. In coastal areas this process may even have led to a form
  
of deglobalisation: Rome’s growing dominance over the ne
twork in some places meant a decrease 
in contacts with other parts of the Mediterranean world. Moreover, ever larger parts of the country -
side fell into the hands of the Roman administra-
tive elite, to which Rome naturally was the primary 
marke
t. Ambitious members of the local upper 
class likewise focussed on the insatiable metro
-
polis. T
rade relations described in written sources 
almost invariably have Rome as their final desti
-
nation. T
hat is not to say that nothing happened 
without Rome being involved: on the Adriatic  
coast Roman influence was less strong than  
on the T yrrhenian side, and existing economic  
networks may have endured. But Roman expan-
sion certainly did not mean that direct economic 
cont
act with other parts of the Roman world 
increased massively and lastingly throughout the Italian peninsula: Rome was binding in all respects.
ye
t the city’s rise to supremacy did influence  
Italy’s economy as a whole in several ways.  
Intensifying trade with other parts of Europe  
from the second century BC caused a temporary 
demand for typically ‘Roman’ products, whic
h  
at that time could only be supplied from Italy.

The ten tabernae (shops) on the ground  floor sold agricultural pro-duce, while oil and wine merchants offered their wares on the first floor.  The Via Biberatica runs through the second floor:  a beautiful street with two sidewalks.

urthermore the import of bulk goods into Rome 
had a number of indirect effects on the economy of the Italian peninsula.
EXpOrT
Export of Italian products to other parts of  
Europe is a phenomenon that started in the  second century BC and reached its peak during 
the two centuries surrounding the beginning  
of the Christian era. It is a well-known fact that 
Latium and Campania e
xported wine on a large 
scale. The trade routes can be traced with the  
aid of amphoras: Italian wine amphoras from  
the second and first centuries BC were found  in great numbers in Gaul, Germany and even  Britain. Some Roman families, such as the Sestii, 
seem to have made their fortunes in this trade.  
It is likely that bulk consumption by the Gauls 
caused the production of wine in central It
aly  
to thrive. Finds of shipwrecks give us an idea  
of the scale of this trade: big ships had a cargo  of many thousands of amphoras, and it is  estimated that between 50,000 and 100,000  hectolitres of wine were shipped every year. 
Croc
kery from Italy became popular as well:  
from the late second century BC there was  
a substantial demand for Campanian ceramics  in southern Gaul. During the Augustan Age Gaul, 
whic
h had been annexed by the empire by then, 
developed into an important market for Italian terra sigillata. Gallic demand led to an increase  
in production at pottery centres like Arretium  
(present-day Arezzo) and to migration of special-ist craftsmen: we know of several potters who 
were active in It
aly as well as Gaul. 
Two aspects deserve special mention here.  
Firstly, there is no direct relation between the growing commerce and the political e
xpansion  
of the Roman Empire: both wine and pottery were already in demand be
fore the annexation of Gaul. 
Secondly, it was a temporary phenomenon: from the end of the first century BC the share of Italian wine amphoras in Gaul declines sharply, because the Gauls started to produce their own wine. The same development is seen half a century later  
in the pottery business—Gallic production centres "

Syria, bringing silk and other luxury goods to  
the metropolis. Sericarii, merchants specialising  in silk, could make a lot of money. Asian spices

The minor role of export is not surprising if  
we take into account that the fundamental  developments in the economy of Roman Italy 
were related to import. Rome’s size was only made possible by subst
antial import of grain,  
olive oil and other necessities from Egypt, Africa and Spain. A
t the same time the Roman elite  
living in Latium and Campania constituted a unique and lucrative marke
t for all kinds of luxury 
goods from every corner of the empire and the rest of the known world. The effect was twofold: on the one hand, Roman citizens went abroad to conduct trade—we know of Roman trade commu -
nities in many cities of Asia Minor and the Near East—while on the other hand foreign merc
hants 
came to Rome and the Bay of Naples to sell their goods. It was easily done, even without previous arrangements: the journey by sea was long and perilous, but finding buyers was never difficult. In Ostia, Puteoli (present-day Pozzuoli) and Rome communities of merchants from various parts of the empire sprang up during the Imperial Age.  
In Puteoli, for instance, we know that a group of merc
hants from T yrus (now T yre, Lebanon) main-
tained a statio or trading post together. There

Until well into the fourth century BC, sea ships used to row up the Tiber to put into the Navalia, Rome’s own harbour. From c.300 BC, the function of sea harbour was transferred  to Ostia, where the local shipowners resided at the Forum of the Corporations. In Ostia, the vessels’ cargo was transhipped to river boats to be transported up the Tiber to the Emporium, Rome’s harbour district.

Taking everything into account, we can conclude 
that despite Roman expansion the economy of Roman Italy was a network primarily focussed  
on Rome, and that it did not become more closely intertwined with the outside world than it had been be
fore. The greatest external influence 
came indirectly, by way of the cosmopolitan  
economies of Rome and the Bay of Naples,  
which in fact were increasingly oriented to the 
outside world. the wealth that the Roman upper class amassed through the growth of the empire. It should be noted, however
, that this was a rather small  
economy, operating in a very limited area and ser
ving a highly specific group of people. In the 
rest of Italy its effects were only felt indirectly. 
InDIrE cT  EFFE cTS
Large-scale import of grain, olive oil and other  
bulk goods from various parts of the empire  
had an impact throughout the Italian peninsula, even though suc
h products were mainly meant  
for Rome. Firstly, these bulk goods were not the sole cargo on the ships, whic
h often carried an 
additional cargo of consumer goods to be sold upon arrival. One of the grounds for the theory that from the Imperial Age onward northern  
African terra sigillata
  dominated the crockery  
market is that these products ‘hitched a lift’  
on ships transporting grain or olive oil to Rome, spreading over It
aly from there. So even import 
products for which we have archaeological evi -
dence did not necessarily reach their final desti -
nation independently from Rome’s supply econ-
omy. Secondly, imported foodstuffs seem to have 
belonged to the lower marke
t segment; written 
sources give the impression that first-rate olive oils and wines were mostly produced in Italy. Rome’s import economy enabled farmers in some regions of the Italian peninsula to concentrate on high-quality products, and to price them accordingly. "

In Antiquity weights played a pivotal  
role in trade. Small weights were usually 
made of bronze, the larger ones of stone. T
he Allard Pierson Museum has several 
in its collection. This beautifully crafted stone weight was given to collector  
C.W. Lunsingh Scheurleer in 1920 by the arc
haeologist and antiquary Professor 
Paul Julius Arndt from Munich. It weighs nearly 3 kg and is finely polished; on  
top it has two indentations to make it easier to hold. It was lightly damaged: S
cheurleer’s old inventory card states 
that about a tenth part is missing.  
That means that it originally weighed  
10 Roman pounds, for 1 Roman pound 
equals a little over 0.32
7 kg. 
The Roman weights system, unlike  
the modern metric system, was based  
on a division into twelve units. The libra 
(pound) was divided into 12 
unciae 
(ounces) of about 27.5 grammes. The uncia was further subdivided into units down to the siliqua (1/144 of an uncia), weighing less than 0.2 grammes. This weights system provided first the Italian peninsula, then the entire Roman Empire with a common measurement to facili -
tate trade. Initially, the Roman monetary system was based on the 
libra as well: 
the coin as weighed one libra of bronze or copper. The as was divided into smaller units down to the uncia (1/12  
of an as). Commonly used multiples of the 
as included the sestertius (4 as), the 
denarius (16 as), and the aureus (400 as). Because metal—and as a consequence, money—went down in value, the smaller units gradually disappeared from the early Imperial Age, until by the reign  
of Marcus Aurelius (161–180) the as  
had become the smallest unit.
T
he inscription in the centre of the basalt 
weight reads: CTORIT Q IVNI RVSTICI PR VRB. The full words are: Ex auctori -
tate Quinti Iunii Rustici Praefecti Urbi, whic
h means ‘by the authority of Quintus 
Iunius Rusticus, prefect of the city [i.e. Rome]’. This inscription gave the weight official validity. In other archaeological collections, there are similar weights  
with the same inscription. Based on this Rusticus’ biography
, we 
can date the weight around AD 165.  
Rusticus was a senator and was pro-
moted to city prefect of Rome in 162/3. He held the office until 1
67/8 AD;  
it meant that he replaced the consul  in case of the latter’s absence. As a 
magistrate he was responsible for the trial of criminals and enemies of the st
ate. We know that in this capacity he 
was involved in the trial in AD 165 of the Christian Justin Martyr, who refused to acknowledge the Roman gods—a capital crime. Rusticus is further known as a teacher, a Stoic philosopher, and a friend of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. In the person of Rusticus, aspects of economy, law, politics, philosophy and religion came together.

Alexandria was founded  
by Alexander the Great c.332/331 BC. Thanks to  its port (one of the most important ones in the east-ern Mediterranean), it was the greatest centre of inter-national trade in the Hel-lenistic period. Just off  the coast, on the island  of Pharos, was one of the Seven Wonders of the  ancient world: the light-house, whose beacon was visible from miles away.threat to his position. From that moment onward,  
a large part of Egypt’s crops was transported to 
Rome; it is estimated at 135,000 tons of grain annually
. In Italy, the port of Puteoli (present-day 
Pozzuoli) was buzzing with excited people every time the grain fleet from Alexandria arrived in June. Egypt even had a grain surplus left that could be bought up on the free market by other big cities, Ephesus (now Efes in Turkey) among others. Export was limited only when famine  
was imminent because of low Nile floods. The Emperor T
rajan, for instance, had the grain fleet 
return to Egypt in AD 99 in order to relieve the Egyptians’ suffering.

But Egypt had more export goods to offer than just grain. Other non-perishable goods, such as Egyptian oil, vinegar, beer (which was already popular in Pharaonic times) and wine (of a lesser quality than Greek wine, but cheaper) were highly competitive products.

The statement that Egypt was Rome’s granary, 
although not quite true (other regions, for instance northern Africa and Sicily, kept up  
an important part of the supply), is meaningful none
theless. The natural riches and the high  
yield of crops in the land on the Nile were a  
blessing to its rulers. The Ptolemies, the Greek-
Macedonian kings who reigned over Egypt be
fore 
the arrival of the Romans, loved to show off their wealth to their fellow kings, sometimes to the point of nausea. When the Emperor Augustus annexed Egypt to his empire, he forbade the members of the senatorial class—the highest class of Roman society—to enter the country,  
for fear that from there they would become a "

East and West, which under the Romans’ influ-
ence reached a peak unknown before. Thanks  to the Red Sea, the country became a go-
be
tween for luxury goods from India, Arabia  
and Africa; pepper and other spices, ivory, pearls and perfumes were cove
ted goods to wealthy 
Romans. Pliny complains about some of these luxury goods, which caused incredible sums of money to drain away to India: ‘Every year India gobbles up over 50 million sesterces of our empire’s riches and in return sends goods which by the time they arrive here cost a hundred times the original price.’ In Egypt alone a toll of 25 per cent was charged on products in transit through the country from the east; the toll was paid in kind, which meant that a quarter of the goods  
had to be left in Alexandria. The magistrates responsible for customs in Egypt acquired  
riches beyond belief.
As it had under the Ptolemies, Ale
xandria played 
a crucial part as an emporium in the Roman period, but the Romans greatly extended the transport network throughout Egypt. The oases  just as easily. Sheets of papyrus were a typical Egyptian e
xport product—nowhere else were  
they produced on such a scale. As early as the first centur
y AD, Egypt was also known for its  
flax and for its production of linen as well. The fibres were processed to te
xtiles locally. Accord-
ing to the Roman author Pliny the Elder (AD 23/
24—79), ‘Egyptian flax isn’t strong at all, but 
available at a very competitive price.’ Pottery was exported in smaller quantities; Egyptian ceramics tried to imitate the typology and tech
 nology of 
Roman potter
y, but never reached the same level 
of quality. Furthermore the Romans were greatly interested in the quarries in the Eastern Desert, such as Mons Claudianus and Mons Porphyrites. Mons Claudianus supplied them with granodiorite, an intermediate rock between granite and diorite which was used in famous Roman buildings:  
Hadrian’s villa, the Pantheon, the baths of Cara-
calla, and Diocletian’s palace. Compared to its

the Nile and supplied olive oil, among other things. By far the biggest investments, however, were made in the Eastern Desert, where long stretches of road connected the Nile to the quarries and  
to the ports of the Red Sea. Most of the ships entering the Red S
ea put in at Berenice, for 
because of strong winds and currents most  
merchants preferred not to go to the port of  
Myos Hormos further north. 
T
he journey through the desert took several  
days, so that stations providing water and  
lodgings had to be constructed: wells along the 
roads were numerous and there were small forts in whic
h travellers could safely spend the night 
with their goods and pack animals. During the day the roads were guarded by soldiers posted here from their legion or auxiliary unit. They kept watch on big towers on the hills along the desert roads and could signal each other with beacons. For  
this cumbersome mission in a hot desert they were granted a day’s leave after ever
y two days. 
Small family businesses specialised in transport through the desert. Sometimes villages emerged in the desert,  
for instance at the quarry of Mons Claudianus. T
he labourers and engineers lived there, some-
times with their wives and children. The Mons Claudianus village had a hospit
al and a temple  
to Serapis; special provisions had been made  
for the pack animals that had to haul the heavy 
building materials to the Nile—suc
h as the fifteen-
metre (almost fifty feet) column incidentally  
mentioned in an official papyrus letter. Fodder  
for the animals, especially barley, could be  requisitioned by the authorities as part of the

So Egypt was excellently integrated into the expanding Roman economic network, but not  
in all areas. Long before the Romans came,  
Egypt had a flourishing currency-based economy: 
drac

liberti who were active in Egypt were often  
immigrants; a good example is Anicetus, son  of Commonus, the Emperor Tiberius’ slave. He 
was an independent businessman in the Eastern Desert. T
his is possibly the same individual as  
the Anicetus who was freed by Nero and was later known as Claudius Anice
tus. In the end  
he succeeded in obtaining one of the best-paid customs houses in the Eastern Desert.T
he arrival of the Romans affected agricultural 
technology, business and landownership. Under the Ptolemies a superior irrigation network had already provided higher yields in agriculture. Under the Romans, the fields that were hard to irrigate were watered more efficiently through  
the introduction of the saqiya, a water wheel  
with big jars that was powered by an ox, mule  or camel. A single saqiya could irrigate two to  thirteen hectares of arable land.
Businessmen, merc
hants and craftsmen some-
times united in guilds. Membership may have been free of obligations until Diocle
tian’s reign  
at the end of the third century AD. The guilds  
protected their members’ rights and arranged P
arallel to the spread of currency, private and 
state banks often emerged, as did credit loans. 
Egypt however was the sole province of the empire that was not annexed into the Roman monetary union, because it was regarded as  
the emperor’s personal domain. People didn’t  
pay in Roman denarii or sesterces, as they did 
elsewhere; they kept using Greek silver drac
hmas 
and bronze coins. Coins minted in Egypt were  
not allowed to leave the country under the Romans any more than they had been be
fore. 
This closed monetary circuit was only abandoned at the end of the third century AD, during the reforms instigated by the Emperor Diocletian. Another important aspect in which Egypt differed from other parts of the empire was the personnel working in the smaller companies. There were  
relatively few slaves in the country: about eight  
to fourteen per cent of the total population.  Slavery wasn’t typical of Egyptian society. Busi-ness owners would rather hire paid employees,  or work in a small company together with family 
members. As a consequence we find f

of land from her father.
Appianus’ best-known est
ate lay in the Fayyum,  
a semi-oasis in the Western Desert; it consisted of several domains. T
hese domains were run by 
managers, while the overall management of the Fayyum estate was in the hands of a supervisor and his assistants. By coincidence the archive  
of Heroninus, one of the managers, has come down to us on papyrus. W
ith approximately 1,000 
texts, it is considered the biggest archive from Roman Egypt. It shows us how such estates were managed and how the local free market func -
tioned. The estate was a private business run  
by a management consciously looking for profit. 
T
he accounts give evidence of advanced methods 
that did not only serve to keep account of the stocks, but also to keep tabs on the profits brought in by the separate domains. The domain that was run by Heroninus mainly produced wine under specific labels that were marketed through professional wine dealers. Thanks to papyrus texts and archives such  
as Heroninus’, we can reconstruct the micro-economy of a Roman province in de

welcome supplement to the sources provided

Businessmen operating in the same field would some
times be concentrated in one quarter of  
a town; this could even be named after them,  
such as the gooseherds’ quarter in the city  of Oxyrhynchus, or the linen workers’ quarter  in the village of Tebtynis.
In pre-industrial times, agriculture and there
fore 
landownership were important sources of wealth. The new tax regime that the Romans put in place in Egypt made it more interesting to buy private land. Landownership gradually became more  
concentrated, particularly after the so-called  
Antonine Plague in the second century AD,  
which took its toll on landowners as well as on  the destitute. In the end a number of large-scale 
landowners, b
oth men and women, emerged  
during the third century. One of the best-known e
xamples is Aurelius Appianus. He belonged  
to what was called the equestrian class—the  
second-highest class in the Roman Empire—and 
was a prominent council member in Ale
xandria. 
Appianus owned several estates. Women could be landowners as well; one of Appianus’ estates was to fall to his daughter Aurelia Appiana

This man, probably a slave or servant,  
is holding an amphora by its handle  with his left hand, the amphora resting 
on his shoulder
. The man is wearing a 
loincloth that doesn’t hide his huge penis. He appears to be walking with the jug, looking back. If you look from the right angle, though, it becomes clear that he  
is bracing himself against the weight  
on his shoulder, his legs bent. The viewer 
is invited to imagine how the wine keeps flowing from the amphora. T
he garland  
in the man’s short hair also suggests  
a joyous occasion. 
Slaver
y was an essential part of ancient 
economy, especially in the Graeco-Roman world. Everywhere, from the  
privacy of the home to international trade, slaves were doing their manifold duties. S
o the man and his jug are  
modelled on daily life, and this terracotta doesn’t have to be a humorous portrait  
or caricature of slaves—although the 
viewer is, and was, free to view it as suc

figurine also represents the ideal of prosperity
. The man’s enormous penis, 
his festive garland and his inexhaustible amphora refer to the dream of luxury  
and prosperity, fertility and virility—a dream that was as vibrant in Ancient Egypt as it is today
.
This figurine gives us an impression  
of how amphoras were hauled from  
the local market to be stored for home 
use, after being transported by land  
and/or sea, by ship or camel. The sight 
of slaves carr
ying amphoras on their 
shoulders must have been common in the Roman period as well. The amphora’s shape, however, is not the elongated one we know was current in Roman Egypt. This specimen corresponds with an early Hellenistic type of amphora found on Rhodes and also in Egypt—so the shape of the vase indicates a date before the Roman period.

These cities and forts along the rivers created an enormous demand for food and consumer goods. Urban populations and soldiers, however, hardly produced any food themselves, so that large quantities had to be imported.The demand was met in part by long-distance trade, mostly over water in big flat-bottomed boats. Remains of grain have been discovered  
on several boats that were excavated. Ships  
carrying barrels of wine were depicted on stone

wine, and fish sauce for consumption in cities and army forts were shipped in from the Mediterra -

The Rhine region west of Cologne and the  
Belgian Hesbaye (Haspengouw in Flemish)—
appro
ximately the lands along the line Cologne-
Maastricht-Tongeren-Bavay—are characterised  
by a moderate relief and loessial soil, providing e
xcellent circumstances for agriculture. In this 
region the villa flourished.The word villa was used throughout the Roman Empire, but the structures that were actually built show regional differences. In the Rhine region many villas consist of a rectangular stone main building with protruding corner rooms, surrounded by outbuildings scattered over the grounds. A  
few vast complexes deviate from this model: in these, the residential part (
pars urbana) has been 
separated from the farming part (pars rustica), while the outbuildings have been arranged on both sides of the tightly planned grounds.Villas are hard to define because of the bewilder -
ing variety in function and appearance, but many sc
holars assume that a villa is a farm using slave 
labour (at least in part), geared towards agricul -
tural production, and closely linked to the city.  
The owner of a sizeable homestead could make  a small fortune by selling the big production sur-plus; he could then invest the money in the villa 
itself, for inst
ance in heated rooms or in mosaics. 
The master of a villa could also choose to invest in the capital—where he would be a member  
of the city council—e.g. by paying for bread and games, or by donating baths. As a consequence villa owners were import
ant benefactors: they 
took care of the city’s food supply as well as its appearance, and in return they obtained renown, political influence and money.The proprietors of lesser homesteads with accordingly smaller yields enjoyed a humbler  
status. They were not on the city council, but  
lived in the country all year round or perhaps  had a house in one of the smaller centres of  habitation. These settlements were called vici 
(singular 
vicus); they lay on a junction of roads or 
streams and served as markets and religious cen -
tres. In a vicus one would also find potteries and workshops producing glass or me
tal artefacts."

tecture or was copied from the porch found in milit
ary barracks. The latter is made likely by  
the presence of veterans from the Roman army  
in these settlements.
T
he fact that adoption of the villa system was  
limited in these regions can be explained in part from the natural environment: the soil types—sand and clay—are unsuited for growing grain on a large scale, and stone for construction is nowhere to be found in this region. T
he soil is much better 
suited to cattle farming, which had been the domi -
nant way of life for centuries: mixed farms in whic
h cattle breeding was the main feature.  
That is not to say, of course, that these settle-
ments did not yield a surplus. 
F
rom the middle of the first century onward,  
the cattleshed parts of the homestead grew  
bigger. From finds of animal bones we can 
deduce a c
hange in herd composition. Further-
more, spindles and weaving weights disappeared in the course of the first centur
y; so did hand-
formed pottery, which was replaced by pottery made on the wheel. During the late Iron Age  
and the first decades of the Roman period, people in this region practised mixed farming and crafts at a level of self-sufficienc
y; from the late first 
century onward, production became more special -
ised and yields were large enough to trade for te
xtiles and ceramics on the market. The settle-
ments’ produce mainly consisted of animal prod-
ucts like meat, dairy, and hides; we also have  evidence that horses were bred and trained, for 
the cavalr
y stationed at the Roman forts, for 
instance. Barley was part of traditional food in this region. It was used by the Roman army as well, but primarily as fodder and as emergency rations for people. The existence of large granaries situ -
ated between the farmhouses makes it probable that a surplus of barley was produced as well.Not only the scarcity of villas, but also the absence of 
vici in most of the sand and clay soil 
region is striking. A few vici have been found along the borders, such as that of Grobbendonk In the area surrounding Tongeren many villas have been dug up, but also settlements consisting of wooden farmhouses and drinking pits for cattle. The villas produced crops for local consumption as well as for cities and forts a bit farther away; the people in the settlements with byre-houses, on the other hand, no doubt kept animals to  
supply the cities and settlements in the vicinity with meat, dair
y and hides.
The emergence of stone villas in the last quarter of the first century AD is striking. There are no stone complexes to be found that certainly existed before that time. For a long time it was assumed that these villas were built from scratch, but recently traces of earlier buildings were found under the stone houses. Settlements built from timber preceded the villas. The date of the change to building in stone, the late first century, makes  
it likely that the villas are connected to the exist-
ence of the province Germania Inferior. At the 
foundation of the province the food supply for  
the cities was probably organised with fore-
thought. Whether the preceding settlements  were expropriated and the complexes given to 
new Roman owners or the e
xisting owners of  
the homesteads were given a place in the  
Roman system remains unknown.

Only a limited number of villas survive in the  sandy soil of the southern Netherlands and  northern Belgium. There are some villas along  the banks of the Maas and Waal, but hardly any 
have been found farther inland. Here we normally find big farmhouses built from wood, clay and straw
, combining a residential part with a built-in 
cattle shed. Although there are visible changes  
in these combined farmhouses from the first  
to the third century AD, the change from timber  
to stone construction was never made. Wooden 
houses were, however
, sometimes given glass 
windows, complete or partial tile roofing, and  
a porticus (porch) made of wooden poles: this shows that Roman residential culture was not entirely unknown here. Arc
haeologically the 
wooden farmhouses are quite different from "

otherwise these secondary centres are missing.  
It would seem that local produce was collected  in the countryside by local leaders and then  transported to cities and forts without need for 
inter
vention by civilian centres. On the coast of 
Zeeland and Belgium the surplus did not consist of farming products but of salt, which was boiled down and packaged in ceramic containers. On a small scale this was already done in the Iron Age, but during the Roman period a huge increase of salt production is visible. The families who lived  
in the combined farmhouses of the coastal area practised mixed farming for their own food supply; salt production provided them with a surplus to pay their t
axes and buy goods they did not pro -
duce themselves.

Surplus production happened on a smaller scale along the rivers and on the sandy soil in the south than it did in the region dominated by villas. As  
a consequence less money was made and the income was not invested in stone arc
hitecture. On 
the other hand, there are similarities with the villa region as well: the local communities on less fertile soil did produce some surplus and traded their pro -
duce for goods from the market. Examples of such goods were foodstuffs (olive oil and fish sauce),

This two-handled silver cup, a skyphos  
in Greek, has a bulbous body (somewhat 
repaired) on a strongly profiled base.  
The composite handles have thumb tabs 
with spiral ornaments. T
his special type 
derives from terracotta cups from late-classical Thebes (c.400 BC); it was later developed in precious metal at Athens and Alexandria. Late-Hellenistic shapes were quite popu -
lar in the early Imperial Age. Silver ves-
sels from this period are known from 
P
ompeii and Herculaneum, for instance, 
and from the silver hoards found at pre -
sent-day Boscoreale (near Naples) and Hildesheim (Germany). W
ealthy Romans 
not only possessed crockery made of glazed earthenware, terra sigillata and glass, but also had bronze and silver tableware to show off. The most luxuri -
ous versions were made of partially gilt silver and decorated with elegant relie
fs. 
Such costly pieces were meant for show rather than use. This cup was probably found at Mainz-Kastel (Wiesbaden, Germany), the Romans’ Castellum Mattiacorum,  
situated at a strategic position on the limes (the b
order of the empire) where 
the river Main joins the Rhine. At the other side of the river was Castrum Mogontiacum (present-day Mainz;  
castrum, like castellum, means ‘army camp’), the capit
al of the Roman prov-
ince of Germania Superior. Despite  the similarity in name, Mainz was not named after the Main; the city’s name  
is a corruption of the Roman settlement’s 
name, while the river was called the Menus in Antiquity
. Castrum Mogontia -
cum, probably founded by the Roman general Drusus Germanicus in 13/
12 BC, 
was named after the Celtic god Mogons. Castellum Mattiacorum, established about a year later, was named after the Mattiaci—a Germanic tribe who accord -
ing to the Roman historiographer Tacitus (c. AD 56–11
7) belonged to the Chatti, 
like the Batavians—, who inhabited the area of the rivers Main and Wetter.Several concentric circles have been engraved at the bottom of the base, which also has a clumsily written  
inscription. It appears to read ‘
ΔΙVΟΜΑIIKΙΙC’. It isn’t Greek, however, 
but a Roman majuscule cursive from  
the first century AD. Three words have been abbreviated and written without spaces: 
DIVOMACCFEC, i.e. Divo 
Macc[ius or -arius] fec[it], ‘Maccius  
(or Maccarius; a silversmith) made this for a deity
.’ Since the deity is not men-
tioned by name, it is likely that the cup was dedicated to a deified st
atesman, 
such as Julius Caesar or Augustus.  
That would be appropriate for such  
a precious cup. 
On the grounds of the Latin inscription  
it is plausible that this silver skyphos was 
made in It
aly, probably in Campania. Its 
early date and finding place indicate a military connection; the inscription could point to a gift to or from an army com -
mander in the emperor’s circle. The  
finding place also proves that luxury 
goods were traded over long dist
ances.  
It remains unclear if this cup was lost  
by accident, deposited as a sacrifice,  or hidden as a treasure.

The Villa of Livia was a  
luxurious countryhouse just outside Rome, owned by Augustus and his wife Livia Drusilla. It was rediscovered in 1596, but recognised as the Villa of Livia only in the nineteenth century. In 1867, the famous Augustus of Prima Porta (now in the Vatican Museums) was found here. The villa has been excavated completely and reconstructed in 3D.  In the triclinium or dining room, the reclining couches were often arranged in  a U shape, in which the host’s and guests’ positions were formally planned.

The Roman food economy was very advanced 
and at the same time radically different from  
the way it had been earlier, or was to be later.  
The Roman Empire was enormous, as was its 
populace, and had a marke
t economy with an 
extensive trade network in which all kinds of goods, people, and ideas were circulating. That makes it interesting to look at the popular food -
stuffs in Roman Italy, the true nerve centre of  
the Roman world.
A high degree of c
hange and innovation is  
characteristic of the Roman world in general,  
and of the organisation of its food economy in 
particular
. That is why we cannot define any single 
diet as typically Roman. The ‘continuous state of change’ that was described earlier in this book certainly applies to the Romans’ food: they were constantly looking for new tastes and ingredients.In this contribution we will first give a brief  
outline of arable farming and fruit growing. Then we will t
ake a look at cattle farming and animal 
foodstuffs form other sources. This distinction, however, didn’t exist in daily life. In the Roman food economy, specialisation did mean that a  
certain foodstuff was optimally exploited, for inst
ance by selective breeding in animals or  
cultivation of plants. But it was just as normal  
for arable farming and cattle breeding to com -
plement eac
h other on a mixed farm. Manure  
was used effectively to improve viticulture,  for instance, and fodder was grown or even  imported in order to optimise cattle farming.

The most important crops that were grown were spelt, einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, and barley. Together they constituted the foundation of the Roman food economy. In order to supplement these staple foods, Roman farmers also grew  
turnips and legumes such as beans and lentils.In his 
De re rustica (On Farming) the Roman 
author Varro (116—27 BC) describes Italy towards the end of the Republic as ‘one big orchard’.  "

The interior of Roman houses was relatively aus-tere, since many activities were outside. Furniture was limited to the necessary things, including the reclin-ing couch for dinners and parties. The ends of these couches could be sumptu-ously ornamented with cast bronze or silver inlay. CHAN GING  DIETS
Without taking this too literally, we can confidently 
state that especially olives and grapes were essential farming products—and trade goods—throughout Italy and in large parts of the Roman Empire. The Roman writer Pliny the Elder (AD 23/24—79) claims that at least eighty varieties  
of grape were known in the Roman Empire, two third of them from It
aly. This degree of specialisa-
tion was combined with intensive wine production. According to Columella, a Roman agriculturalist who lived in the first centur
y AD, Roman wine 
growers produced approximately 21 hectolitres  
of wine per hectare, which is similar to modern wine growers’ production. One of the causes of their success was the Roman custom to keep  
cattle near the vineyards, so that the soil could  
be fertilised intensively. 
A famous e
xample to illustrate the incredible 
scale on which olive oil was produced comes  
from Rome, where during the Imperial Age an artificial hill rose up in what is now the T
estaccio 
quarter. It consists of the remains of over 50  
million amphoras used to transport olive oil,  
mainly from the province of Baetica (southern 
Spain). Shipwrec
ks provide important evidence as to 
which kinds of fruit were grown and eaten in  
the Roman world. Amphoras have surfaced with e
xotic fruits such as dates from the Middle East 
and coconuts from India. Pomegranates, peaches, nectarines, quinces, cherries, jujubes, carob pods, mirabelle plums and citrus fruit were not only imported, but also grown in Italy itself. In their constant search for innovation the Romans  
also cultivated many new varieties of fruit. Pliny mentions no less than forty-one varie
ties of pear, 
twenty-eight kinds of fig, twenty-two apples, eight types of cherry, seven races of quince, and five each of peaches and plums.

husbandry: alternate use of a field for crops  and as fallow land used for pasture), this made  for optimal yields in arable farming as well as  cattle breeding.
F
rom the late Republican period on, the popula-
tion of Roman Italy grew explosively. This made  
a more specialised supply of food necessary  that was based on a market economy instead  of self-sufficiency. It also caused pigs to become 
increasingly import
ant as a source of meat, 
because of the relatively fast production cycle  
and therefore high meat yield of pigs.Cow breeds were also being improved. Roman written sources mention a tot
al of nine different 
cow breeds; all of them have been identified recently in the finds of animal bones at various Roman excavations. It is noteworthy that espe -
cially during the late Republican period and the Imperial Age the shoulder height of Roman cows on average was twenty centime
tres higher than 
that of cows from earlier periods—and than that  
of medieval cows. This indicates breeding strate-farming was based on cows, pigs, sheep and goats. T
he latter two were herded in large  
combined flocks. Sheep were not only bred  
for their meat and milk, but especially for their 
wool. Moreover
, sheep’s milk yields about twice  
as much cheese as goat’s milk, which explains  
the predominance of sheep in the mixed herds. 
T
he fact that the Latin word for money, pecunia, 
derives from the word pecus (cattle) is a clear indication of the importance of cattle farming  
in early Roman society. Big floc
ks of goats and sheep were herded using 
a transhumance system: the seasonal movement of the livestock between specific pastures. During summer the animals would graze on the higher pastures; then they were moved to pastures on the lower plains before winter arrived. In Italy this herding strategy can be traced back to the Bronze Age. From the late Republic onward, trans

T

several written sources from Antiquity refer to chicken dishes. We know that the Romans not only ate omelettes, but also stuffed chicken and even ground chicken brains. Initially chickens were fattened up with special nutritious fodder, but after this practice had been legally curbed in 161 BC following concerns about moral decay and excessive luxury, Roman farmers soon found out that castrating roosters makes them gain weight automatically; this discovery gave rise to the ani -

T
he hunt was not a significant part of the Roman 
food economy, but was seen as a pastime for  
the elite. Both archaeological and iconographic sources indicate that wild b
oar were the main  
target of the hunt. T
he Roman food economy of the late Republic 
and the Imperial Age is characterised by the  
staggering variety of native and exotic foodstuffs that were available to people. Recent researc
h  
at the Stabian Gate in Pompeii, conducted by  
the University of Cincinnati in the USA, has shown 
that even species suc
h as the flamingo and the 
giraffe were on the menu. So meat of exotic  
species was traded and transported over long  
distances; but the Romans also bred all kinds  of smaller animals that were eaten as snacks.  A good example is the so-called edible dormouse 
(
Glis glis), which was kept and fattened in big 
storage jars with air holes, to end up as an  
hors-d’oeuvre for the Roman elite. Remains of fish are hardly ever significant in  
pre-Roman archaeological finds in Italy. It would 
appear that fish, b
oth fresh and preserved, was 
not an intensively exploited source of nutrition until the Roman era. The increase was partly caused by an innovation that can be dated to  
the third century BC: from then on, various fish species were bred in ponds. T
he phenomenon 
was a pastime for the Roman upper class, but  
it also served economic purposes. The earliest arc
haeological remains of fish ponds in Roman 
villas date from the second century BC. Fish also served as the main ingredient of  
several sauces (garum, allec, liquamen) that were regarded as great delicacies. S
o it isn’t surprising 
that many varieties, often local, of fish sauces such as garum were circulating in the Roman world, made of various species of fish that were caught locally. Pompeii, for example, was known as a garum production and trade centre. It is  
possible that evidence was recently found of  
a kosher type of garum, made of scaleless fish 
species and meant for the Jewish population  
of Pompeii, but scholars so far disagree on the 
matter
. 
It was mostly small species such as grey mullet, anchovy and mackerel that were used in prepar -
ing these sauces, but tuna fishing was intensive as well. T

In Antiquity, wine was transported in  
various types of container. Ceramic 
amphoras were used for long-dist
ance 
trade; for personal use, there was the wineskin, called askos in Greek. In mythology, Askos is a son of the Titan Kronos. Dionysos, god of wine, was chased by Askos and fell into the water. Hermes got Dionysos out and punished Askos by skinning him. He sewed a bag from the skin and kept his wine in it. Wineskins have been in use since time immemorial. The Romans mostly used pigs’ or goats’ skins, occasionally cows’. Once the animal had been skinned, the legs were sewn closed and the neck was left open to fill and empty the wineskin. Pitch was put on the seams to make  
the skin ‘winetight’. T
he shape of this little bronze jar from 
the second century AD, just over 10 cm high, derives from the wineskin, which  
is clearly recognisable from the four  
legs and tail. To prevent the wine from 
running out, you have to se
t the askos  
on its behind, so to speak. A piece of rope round the nec
k indicates how the 
opening could be tied closed. The detailed genitals are a striking feature—the skin apparently was a bull’s. In his work Satyricon, the Roman author Petronius (c. AD 27–66) compares  
people to inflated wineskins. Wineskins also played a part in a wine f
estival 
named after them: the Askolia, during which peasants got drunk on the young wine. These wild parties probably involved throwing askoi as well, although it is unclear whether they were filled with wine or inflated with air like a football.

Commerce also brought new ingredients to Egypt, from India for instance, in order to keep up with the elite’s changing palate. Our knowledge of Roman Egyptian cuisine is  
limited to ingredients, because unfortunately  
no recipes have come down to us. What we do 
have is numerous re
ferences to food in Greek 
papyri, especially if growing or selling these food -
stuffs was tax-regulated. In Karanis (an agricul-
tural town, modern Kom Aushim in the Fayyum) 
arc
haeologists have found remains of food such 
as seeds and stones and even the remains of loaves of bread, providing us with information  
to supplement the papyrus texts.

Then as now, bread was the main staple food  
in Egypt. The grain used to bake it had always 
been emmer wheat, but from the Hellenistic period on it was replaced by a new grain: durum wheat, whic
h is still popular today. Research by 
René Cappers of Groningen University shows  
that this change was motivated by practical  
considerations. Durum wheat needs no husking, 
so that less lab
our is involved; another advantage 
is that it takes up less space. That was an impor -
tant factor in producing and shipping the grain to Rome and other countries, an activity that rapidly gained import
ance in the Egyptian economy. 
Barley was grown as well. It was used as fodder and to brew beer. According to Cappers, barley was used in bread as well. Usually these would  
be the flat bread that is still baked in Egypt today. It could be eaten fresh, but could also be dried
 
quickly in the oven to make it keep longer. Dried bread could be made edible again with water or oil."

The wine had a high alcohol percentage, approxi-mately fifteen to sixteen per cent, and was usually 
watered be
fore it was served. Herbs or honey 
could be added to improve the taste. In that case, the wine was first poured into a large bowl to be mixed, then transferred into jugs or bottles with  
a ladle. Imported wines, from the islands in the Aegean for inst
ance, were also popular in Egypt. 
Another important part of daily meals, apart from grain and wine, was oil. It was used as it is in modern Mediterranean cuisine: to add flavour to vegetables, to dip bread, and to fry meat. Olive oil was used nearly everywhere in the Mediterranean countries; Egypt was an exception. Traditionally, course of the Roman period, beer brewing stopped completely. From the fourth century  
AD onward the Egyptians apparently drank only  
wine, as the Greeks did. In the Coptic texts  written after that, beer isn’t mentioned either.
T
he fact that the Nile delta and the oases pro-
duced some first-rate wines naturally was a factor in this process. T
here were various qualities: from 
expensive to cheap, from tart to excellent. Wine vinegar was produced as well. During the Hellen -

Once Augustus had de-feated his opponents— including Pompey, Mark Antony, and Cleopatra— he established his power as princeps (‘the first’) in Rome.

quantities of it. Sheep and goats were bred  for their meat as well as their wool. 
By far the most popular meat was pork. In the houses of Karanis, for inst
ance, many bones  
of pigs have been found. Pork was sometimes pic
kled or salted for preservation; it could also 
serve to make sausages. Rabbits were eaten as well, and so were pigeons, as we can conclude from the dovecotes found on the roofs of houses in Karanis and the Dakhla Oasis, among other places. In the oases gazelle would be on the menu now and then, and probably so would camel. Poultry, which was likely eaten from Pharaonic times onward, included chicken,  
quail, goose and duck.W
ritten sources often mention fish; all fish  
species were eaten, apart from those considered sacred. V
arious species could be sacred, and 
therefore taboo, in various places. Since fish quickly went bad in the hot climate, it was mostly dried or salted so that it would keep longer and could be transported over longer distances. Garum, the Romans’ spicy fish sauce, was imported, but also produced in Egypt itself.  
There were white and black types of garum,  
and wine garum—the black one was considered 
the best.Egyptians used castor oil, an oil pressed from  
the seeds of the castor bean plant. During the Hellenistic age it was replaced by sesame oil, whic
h may have been introduced by the Greeks 
because it was a better alternative to olive oil. Castor oil remained in use in Egypt as oil for lamps and as the cooking oil used by native inhabitants. It was not until late Antiquity that olive oil was  
produced on a large scale in Egypt. Oil was pressed from others plants as well: from croton and safflower
, for instance, and from linseed,  
radish and horseradish. Then there was lakhanon, a general word for vege
tables that could also  
be used for a specific plant, possibly a kind of  
lettuce, which was likewise used for large-scale 
oil production in the Roman period. Radish oil  
was the cheapest kind, but it had the disadvan-
tage of a strong smell.

We can safely say that a rich variety of foodstuffs was available in Roman Egypt, which makes it plausible that the meals of the upper class were savoury and varied. The close connection to other parts of the Roman Empire obviously had its advantages for the Egyptians, and this must have had a positive influence even on the diet of the poorer population.VEGET a BLES , FrU IT, anD

Legumes were an inexpensive and therefore  
popular food. Lentils are mentioned in written 
sources and have been found at Karanis. W

read about white beans, broad beans, chick peas and fenugreek, which was ground and used as flour. Lupin seeds were probably eaten the way they still are in Egypt: soaked and salted (which goes very well with a glass of beer). The same goes for watermelon seeds, which were roasted and salted to eat as a snack. Nuts were consumed in Egypt as well, although  
it is impossible to say whether they were imported or grown locally

As to vegetables, the sources mention endive, beet, garlic, cabbage, purslane, radish, wild celery, lettuce, and onions.

Numerous herbs and spices were for sale as well, such as aniseed, basil, cinnamon, Chinese cinnamon, cumin, caraway, coriander, mint, pepper, rosemary, sesame, balsam seeds, garden cress, rue, and black mustard.Fruit was available in equally large quantities.  
In Karanis, archaeologists have found remains  
of dates, figs, lotus fruits and peaches. The date 
was the most popular fruit and occurs the most often in te
xts, but we can’t tell in what quantities  
it was consumed. Text sources have also revealed a good many fruits that were known in Roman Egypt: apricots, apples, lemons, grapes, pome -
granates, jujubes, plums, olives, sugar melons,  
and sycamore figs. Peaches, apricots and plums 
were newcomers on the menu. In the fifth centur

the banana was added as well.Cheese is often mentioned in the papyri, and  
we know that there was trade in it. In all likelihood this mainly concerned sheep’s and goat’s c
heese, 
and only rarely cheese made of cow’s milk. One papyrus also mentions cheese with caraway.

Like Isidorus’ stela (see p. 105), this 
gravestone was found at Terenuthis (modern Kom Abu Billu, c.70 km north-west from Cairo). The deeply chiselled low relief depicts a man reclining on  
a couch, wearing a richly draped, long garment with short sleeves, and a cloak over it. He is cleanly shaven and has short hair
. The man is looking straight  
at us, a skyphos (two-handled cup) in  
his right hand. With his left arm, which  is covered by the cloak, he is leaning  
on two chequered pillows. There is a 
c

couch, which has a back curved like  
a swan’s neck. In front of it are four votive gifts: an amphora in a st

a small table with legs ending in lion’s eGyP t
paws, and two sheafs of corn to the sides. Under the picture, at the left, there is a rough carving in Greek, ΑΡΠΟΚΡΑΤΗC, followed by some characters too dam -
aged to read. So the deceased was named after the god Harpocrates, whic
h 
was common enough. The name occurs throughout the country from the second century BC to the fourth AD, in several versions including Egyptian (spelt Ḥr-pȝ-ẖrd).Hundreds of similar gravestones in  
Hellenistic style have been excavated  
at the cemetery of Terenuthis, but in  this one some Egyptian elements are 
discernible as well. Harpocrates’ garment is draped in unnatural parallels. His right leg appears to float ab
ove the left leg, 
following Egyptian tradition, and the face reminds one of the hieroglyph for ‘face’. These stylistic aspects point to a later date than that of the Isidorus stela.  The artist who made the stela for  
Harpocrates was probably trained in  the Egyptian style and therefore likely 
was an Egyptian. W
e don’t know whether the ethnic  
background of the deceased was  
Egyptian as well. The relief speaks of  the wish that Harpocrates enjoy his  dinner and wine on his reclining couch  
in the afterlife, too—an aspect that does 
not fit the traditional Egyptian idea of the afterlif
e. The skyphos in his hand and the 
amphora by his couch indicate that espe -
cially this element, the wine, appealed to the bereaved in c
hoosing the stela to pay 
their last respects. Thus the stela illus -
trates the degree to which Graeco-Roman and Egyptian culture were inter-
twined.

The Roman occupation of the southern half of  
the Low Countries from the first to the fourth  century AD went hand in hand with major 
c
hanges in politics, economy, and lifestyle. The 
large-scale recruitment of soldiers among the Batavians and to a lesser extent Cananefates had far-reaching consequences. Not only did this take away a large number of men in the prime of their lives, but the soldiers who returned to their home country after the end of their service brought with them a whole range of new ideas, knowledge and skills. The Roman army thus played an important role in the spreading of ‘Roman’ culture and  
technology.Another new development was the st
art of  
urbanisation. The inhabitants of the new towns, vici
 (villages) and military camps did not produce 
their own staple food, and were partly supplied with food by local farmers. This led to trade con -
tacts between the rural population on the one hand and the urban and milit
ary ones on the 
other. While some of the agrarian surplus may have been used to fulfil tax requirements, the large amounts of Roman pottery and other arte -
facts found in rural settlements indicate that some of the surplus was e
xchanged for money, allowing 
people from the countryside to buy products on the town markets. This formed a marked contrast with the Iron Age, when people produced nearly everything they needed themselves. 
nEW  TYpE S  OF  FOOD
Wherever the Romans went, they brought their preferred foods with them. They introduced  
chickens to the Low Countries, which have 
become an import
ant part of the diet since.  
Oysters were such a quintessential part of the Roman die
t that in some inland parts of Europe, 
they have been used as an indicator for a Roman date. In the Low Countries, oysters and other  seashells were already exploited in earlier periods; during the Roman period, however
, they were 
transported over larger distances and could now also be found far inland. Another typically Roman product was bread, which requires a different type of cereal from those traditionally grown in most parts of the Low Countries. The traditional grains were eaten as gruel or flat cakes. Herbs such as dill, coriander and celery flavoured meals in city, country and army camp alike. Vegetables such  
as leaf beet, fruits such as damsons and cherries, and walnuts provided varie
ty. It was not just the 
new plant species themselves that were intro -
duced, but also the methods to grow and propa-
gate them, in orchards and kitchen gardens. 
Olive oil, wine, fish sauce, 
defrutum (a grape  
product that could be used as a sweetener,  
preservative, or—mixed with fish sauce—as a  condiment) and dried fruits such as figs were  all imported from the Mediterranean. Sherds  from transport amphoras are frequently found  
in excavations of rural settlements as well as in 
towns and army camps. T
he problem with ampho-
ras is that they lend themselves well for second-
ary use, for instance to store cereals or as build-ing material. Therefore, we cannot be certain that 
these products were actually used in rural se
ttle-
ments; the amphoras may have been empty when they arrived there. In the case of fish sauce amphoras, secondar
y use for storage is less likely, 
since the persisting smell would flavour whatever was stored. Apart from amphoras, wine barrels are another indication for the import and con -
sumption of wine. Wine barrels are usually found only because they have been used secondarily  
in well constructions. As with amphoras, it is 
impossible to know for cert
ain whether wine  
barrels arrived in rural villages full or empty.  
However, finds of wine sieves and jugs in com -
bination with amphoras make it likely that people 
drank wine here. W
hile cereals, olive oil, wine and fish sauce were 
the staples of the Roman diet, accessible to all, finds of other foodstuffs attest to the luxury side of Roman cuisine. A pot with preserved song thrush breasts, imported from the Ardennes, has been found in the first-century fort on the Kops "

Not everyone in the Roman Low Countries was eating the same kind of food. First of all, differ-
ences remained between the inhabitants of 
towns, forts and rural villages. Bread wheat,  
spelt wheat and oysters, for instance, are common 
finds in urban and milit
ary sites, but less so in 
rural sites. Some imported plant foods, such as almonds and peaches, are exclusively found on military sites. Villas are a special kind of rural

Roman period. Again, we cannot be entirely  
certain that they were used in the way for  which they were designed, but finding mortaria  as well as Roman herbs and spices strongly  suggests that this was the case. 
T
he way in which food was served and eaten  
also changed. While food was usually eaten  
from bowls in the late Iron Age, in the Roman 
period plates are also found. T
o dine in a ‘Roman’ 
manner, one needed special vessels to serve  
food, and a set of crockery with different bowls and plates for diff
erent courses. The best evi-
dence for the introduction of such sets of table-
ware comes from cemeteries, with complete  sets found in Nijmegen-West, Tiel-Passewaaij, 
and Nijmegen-Hatert. 
cHanGES  In FOOD  pr ODU cTIO n 
The presence of a military and urban population placed new demands on food production. Farmers started producing a surplus of cattle, horses,  
barley, and emmer wheat. Large granaries found  
in rural sites indicate both an increased production that e
xceeded local needs, and centralised stor-
age, suggesting a hierarchy among settlements. Large-scale processing of cattle by prof
essional 
butchers is a typically Roman urban phenomenon, and has been recognised on sites in present-day Nijmegen and Tongeren. The cattle not only  
provided meat, but also leather, horn, grease  
and bone, which were all worked or produced  
by different specialists. Urban butchery methods 
were aimed at speed and highly e
fficient. Butch-
ery practices in rural settlements were influenced by the Roman way of butc
hering, and show an 
increased use of the cleaver, resulting in an increase in chop marks. Besides the production of fresh meat, meat  
was also preserved. Concentrations of cattle shoulder-blades from sites in Nijmegen, with  
perforations caused by a hook from which they 
were hung in smoking c
hambers, and typical 
butchery marks indicate that shoulder hams  
were produced on a large scale. Similar butchery marks found on shoulder-blades from rural sites show that consumption of smoked meat was  
not limited to towns. A shoulder-blade from a and emmer wheat, still dominated the die
t, which 
means that gruel and flat cakes rather than bread formed the staple food. Meat was mostly beef  
and lamb. Horse meat, which was not part of  
the Roman diet, was occasionally eaten in rural 
se
ttlements. How the elements of the Roman  
diet were incorporated into traditional cuisine remains uncert
ain. 
Some of the new types of food were not just accessible to those living within the Roman Empire. One example of this is chicken, bones  
of which have been found in sites north of the river Rhine (suc
h as Castricum-Oosterbuurt,  
Paddepoel, and Wijnaldum).

the Mediterranean are likely to have stuck to their 
accustomed diet, while the diet of rural people became a mix of the old and the new. The Roman army played an important role in the spread of the new foods and knowledge. After twenty-five years in the army, auxiliaries would return to their native villages. It must have been these veterans who spread the new ideas about food, food prepara -
tion, and the tools and products required for a Roman cuisine. T
he availability of these foods and 
products at markets in the area meant that it was now possible to ‘eat Roman’ even in this distant corner of the Roman Empire. horse with the same butchery marks was found  
in the castellum or vicus of Kesteren. Since there is hardly any evidence for the consumption of horse meat outside rural se
ttlements, this may  
be an indication that some butchers were unscru-
pulous and passed off horse meat as beef. 
TraDE
Food finds from the Roman Low Countries  indicate extensive and well-organised trade  networks. Some luxury and exotic foods, such  as preserved mackerels, olives and grapes, were 
traded over long dist
ances. Figs covered the same 
distance, but were much commoner and seem  
to have lacked the status of the other products. Olive oil, wine and fish sauce were traded over similar dist
ances, but on a much larger scale. 
Remains of the products themselves have not been found, but amphoras which contained  
them are widespread.Bread wheat and spelt wheat also had to be imported, since most of the Roman L
ow Countries 
was unsuitable for growing these cereals. They were produced by villas on loess soils in present-day South Limburg, Belgium and northern France, and transported by ship along the rivers Rhine and Meuse to Ulpia Noviomagus (Nijmegen), Forum Hadriani (Voorburg) and the military camps. A sunken ship found in Woerden con -
tained a load of emmer wheat; the weeds found among the grain indicate that it was grown on loess soil, so apparently even cereals that could be grown locally were imported. Meat animals  
are likely to have been bred in the Roman Low Countries; they were herded to the towns and army camps to be slaughtered. S
ome pigs and 
chickens (for meat as well as eggs) may have been kept inside the towns. Vegetables and herbs were perhaps grown on small plots on the edge of towns, but it is also possible that the rural  
settlements produced a small surplus of these products.

Italian wines weren’t always high-quality, 
but they were also less expensive than the highly valued Greek wines. The  
grand cru among the Italian wines was the white F
alernian, grown on the slopes 
of Mount Falernus between Latium and Campania and famous for improving  
with age. Phoenician wine was also held in high regard (e.g. those from Byblos in Asia Minor and the Phoenician colony  
of Carthage in present-day Tunisia), as was Carmanian wine from P
ersia. Egypt, 
on the other hand, produced cheap wine and wine vinegar for drinking. Wine pro -
duction and consumption were spread over Gaul (F
rance) and Germania (the 
Rhine region) as well, thus covering the whole empire. Sweet or sweetened white wine was especially popular; spices or other aromas were often added to the wine. The alcohol percentage (up to  
c.15 per cent) also was a bit higher  
than nowadays. 
W
ine was stored and traded unfiltered  
in amphoras, so that the thick turbid  
fluid had to be sieved before serving. 
Drinking unwatered wine was considered bad manners, even ‘barbaric’
. Wine was 
diluted with water, sometimes sea water or snow (in winter), to make it less thick and strong. From the mixing bowl or krater the wine was ladled into an  
oinochoe (jug) and then poured into  
a kylix (shallow cup) or skyphos. 
T
his gleaming bronze sieve was used  
for wine. The holes form an elegant  
pattern. Judging from the quality it was 
probably manufactured in Campania: from the first centur
y BC onward, this 
region around the bay of Naples held  
a prominent position in the trade in bronze vessels. T
his Campana supellex (‘Campanian utensils’) has been discov -
ered outside Italy in Gaul and Germania and as far as Egypt. T
his sieve was discovered near Nijmegen 
in the Netherlands (Ulpia Noviomagus).  
It illustrates the trade between Italy and the L
ow Countries as well as the fact 
that wine consumption covered the  
border regions of the Roman Empire. T
he sieve was probably fished out of  
the river Waal and therefore hardly has any patina, but this also means that the original colour has been preser
ved well. 
Perhaps a soldier lost it or threw it away, but the good condition makes it likelier that it was thrown into the river as a  
sacrifice. Sacrificing utensils by throwing them into a stream was normal practice in Antiquity

In AD 118–225, the Emperor 
Hadrian had the P
antheon 
(‘temple to all the gods’) in Rome reconstructed in its present circular shape. The Pantheon is the finest ex-ample of Roman circular temple architecture. Its striking dome was made  of concrete. The diameter of the dome equals the  distance between the floor and the oculus (‘eye’, the central opening) in the dome: 43.30 metres. The oculus is has a diameter  of 8.7 metres and is actual-ly open. In AD 609, the Pantheon was dedicated  as a Christian church by Pope Boniface I.In terms of religion and world views in

r
oman originals decorated with some local 
features, nor were they continuations of local tradition with 
r
oman trimmings. They were 
new creations in which everybody was involved and which tapped into the whole range of local and supraregional religious phenomena. The local and the supraregional sometimes changed places in this process: the essentially Egyptian goddess Isis  
changed into a universal mother goddess who enjoyed gr

the empire. The roman god Jupiter started  
to play a part in celtic-German cultures;

the Low countries. again, the concepts

and ‘
r
omano-Egyptian’: the pantheon of  
the empire was a new pantheon.a
round the beginning of the 
c
hristian era,  
the city of Lugdunum (present-day Lyon, F

r
oma and 
a
ugus-
tus. This exemplifies a ruler cult that was  
new to the roman Empire. It was connected 
to the position of emper

introduced shortly before, but the emperor 
cult we see emerging throughout the empire was a local initiative that was not copied from the city of

Individuals and communities could make their own choices, as polytheistic systems allow—with the advent of 
c
hristianity, all that was  
to change fundamentally. as we have seen, 
the original ethnic bac

This was illustrated in the Introduction with the example of a soldier from Gaul taking  
Isis with him to Britannia. For the empire

In his Histories, written around the middle of the 
second century BC, the Greek author Polybius remarks that the Romans have an exceptional respect for their gods, both in the private and in the public domain—a characteristic that, according to Polybius, was an important part of their identity and that distinguished them from other peoples. We also know that particularly in this period Roman religion actively incorporated all kinds  
of outside influences and adapted to them.  
A famous example is the introduction of the  goddess Cybele in Rome in 205 BC, from Pessi-nus (present-day Ballıhisar, Turkey) in Asia Minor. 
T
he Romans called her Magna Mater (‘Great 
Mother’) and dedicated a temple on the Palatine to her. On the other hand, her cult was to remain very ‘un-Roman’ over the following centuries. Before reviewing various types of religion in Italy, more or less in chronological order and guided by this paradoxical opposition of self and other, we have to define what exactly we mean by ‘religion’.
EVErY THI n G  IS  rE LIGIO n
Religion in the ancient world was founded on  
a belief in the supernatural, combined with the 
thought that the supernatural cares ab
out human 
beings. People and the supernatural could make contact with one another: communication is the purpose of most rituals. Religion in Antiquity was fundamentalist in the sense that no area of life was considered to be outside of religion. Every -
thing in the Roman world was religious in some way
. Religion and politics, for example, could 
hardly be distinguished from each other in any meaningful way. The Roman emperor was supreme ruler and high priest, temples were paid for by the local elite and could also serve as city archives, and so on. Those were the sacra publica. Then there were the sacra privata: innumerable religious customs that could be invoked depend -
ing on context and personal need. This enormous range included what we would now call magic  
or ‘witchcraft’—whether it was seen as such in 
Antiquity
, depends on the question whether  
certain behaviour was considered undesirable.  
Of course the sacra publica and privata over-
lapped.
Historians and arc
haeologists, inspired by  
Polybius’ remark or otherwise, initially went in searc
h of the most ancient phases of Roman  
religion: those of the city itself. Reliable and  
relevant source material on the Archaic and early 
Republican periods, however
, is scant. But there  
is a more fundamental problem as well: a search for the pure, true religion of Rome, unt
ainted by 
influences from outside, is a search for something "

On this cover of a two-spouted lamp, a Capitolium is depicted between olive trees, bunches of grapes, and masks. The Romans worshipped the three gods Jupiter, Juno and Minerva as a group; this so-called Capitoline Triad held a  central position in Roman religion. Its temple, the Capitolium, stood on the Capitoline Hill at Rome. During the early Imperial Age, Capitolia were built  on hills in many cities of the Roman Empire.

The Lares held an impor-tant position in Roman  religion. They were the  protectors of the home,  the family and the land; they were invoked on  important family occasions. Every Roman home had  a lararium or shrine dedi-cated to these protecting gods, originally in the atri-um (central room) mostly. Next to statuettes of the Lares, other patron gods and ancestors were also represented around the  altar.CHAN GING  WORLD  VIEWS
that never existed. At the moment when Rome 
first enters our view, it is an ‘Etruscan’ city and therefore already a tangle of Italian, Etruscan  
and Greek cultural elements, to name only the most import
ant ones that we can distinguish. 
From then on, ‘Roman religion’ is a constantly evolving phenomenon, continuously receiving fresh influences from outside. As Rome expands, increasingly becoming a part of the wider Medi -
terranean world, its religion grows with it. From c.200 B
C onward, this connectivity rises and 
intensifies until Rome has become a Hellenistic city with a Hellenistic upper class.
rELIGIOUS  IM pE r IaL ISM
Although the Romans claimed to be conservative, it was their open mind to other cultures that seems to have powered their ability to conquer.  
In this view Roman imperialism was not only  
political and military in nature, but also cultural  in the sense that they used conquered cultures  to shape their own culture and identity. And in 
Antiquity religion was an import
ant part of culture, 
perhaps the most important. It is in the area of religion that the theory of Roman cultural imperi -
alism is confirmed. A good example is the Roman appropriation of Carthaginian gods, even (indeed especially) during the S
econd Punic War (218— 
201 BC), one of the bitter wars between Rome and Carthage (situated in modern T
unis). This 
method—asking the gods of the enemy to change sides and favour Rome—was applied often, espe -
cially in relation to open enemies. After all, Rome would be waging a just war sanctioned by the gods, whic
h of course applied to every war Rome 
waged. It was not only a matter of war, however: in 293 BC, Rome welcomed the Greek god Askle -
pios (Latin Aesculapius). In his wake came Zeus and P
ersephone (Dis Pater and Proserpina) in 
249, Aphrodite (Venus Erycina) in 217, and Cybele, as mentioned, in 205. Did Rome’s receptiveness to the exotic grow as its sphere of influence grew? It seems rather that it already was a funda -
mental characteristic of Roman religion. In which case that religion itself must have been a collec-
tion of adoptions and adaptations of the exotic. 
W
e shouldn’t forget the context: Italy was much 
more than just Rome. The city and the surround -
ing land of Latium were inhabited by the Latins, but there were more It
alian peoples. Then there 
were Greeks, Etruscans, and Celts. In Italy there was an unequalled diversity of ethnicities, lan -
guages, and cultures. There is a long-standing debate over the question to whic

This is the so-called  
Decennalia base, the base of a column erected on the Forum Romanum in AD 303 to celebrate the tenth anniversary (decennalia)  of the Tetrarchy—the four-emperor rule instituted by Diocletian. The relief de-picts a suovetaurilia, one  of the most sacred rites in Roman religion, consisting in the sacrifice of a sus (pig), ovis (sheep) and  taurus (bull), usually to the god Mars. It could serve  as a purification ritual  (lustratio) or could be per-formed during a triumphal procession or religious  festival. With this sacrifice, the god’s blessing on the land was intreated, temples were dedicated, and lustre was added to important events. 
influence, however, appears to have been little  
or partial for a long time: local cultures turned out 
to be resist
ant and weren’t lost easily—although 
they must have been integrated into an increas -
ingly dynamic whole of mutual influences, just  
like it happened in Rome itself. In the end, Italy 
was transformed into Rome’s ‘surrounding  
countryside’; sometimes the landscape itself  
was restructured. Cultural uniformity followed  
and Rome’s religion became dominant as well— a religion which, as we have already seen, already 
was an amalgam of religious customs that the It
alian peninsula and the world had to offer.
FrOM pOL YTHEISM  TO  MO n OTHEISM
The religion of the city of Rome was a city-state religion like innumerable others in the Mediterra-
nean world: with a mythology, a pantheon and  
rituals, in part public and centred around sanctu-aries, in part private. The central rituals were those 
of procession and sacrifice, votive and prayer
,  
divination, and purification. Particularly in Rome, the social-political upper class controlled these rituals. T
he upper class supplied the candidates peninsula was Hellenised by the Greek cities  
on Sicily and in southern Italy and to which degree the e
xpansion of Rome’s power in Italy 
meant a ‘Romanisation’. The matter is rather  
complicated. There was direct Greek influence  
in Etruria, Latium, and Campania; elsewhere 
Greek culture was spread mainly by Rome, it seems. Hellenisation, in that case, was Roman
-
isation. But other It
alian peoples, such as the 
Samnites and the Lucanians, were influencing other cultures as well. From a very early stage, then, there were many similarities between  
religious practices in the various ethnic groups: priesthood, religious calendars, rituals and burial rites were surprisingly uniform. T
here were differ -
ences as well, naturally. Throughout Italy the  
dead were cremated, but the way in which the 
ashes were buried diff
ered from community to 
community, as did the burial gifts. The Etruscans tended towards richly decorated tombs with many gifts, while the Latins preferred austere graves. In the long run Rome expanded its power over  
the entire peninsula, which gave rise to a ten-
dency towards more uniformity. Rome’s cultural "

This marble relief shows a woman’s and 
a man’s portrait busts inside a sculpted circle. Their heads are slightly turned towards each other. The way this couple  
is immortalised on their grave monument is called an 
imago clipeata, a portrait in  
a medallion. This type of relief occurs from the third centur
y AD onward. 
The medallion is held by two Tritons, mermen from Greek mythology, in this case with double fish tails. They are often depicted in combination with  
dolphins, as here: the dolphins are sup-
porting the medallion with their dorsal 
and t
ail fins. In the Tritons’ hair, drilling 
grooves are clearly visible: the relief was not only hewn with the chisel, but a drill was used as well. Next to the Tritons we can just see parts of two female figures. These are Nereids, daughters of the sea god Nereus. There is a striking difference in style in the way the man and the woman are depicted. The man’s hairstyle is the one that was fashionable during the reign  
of Gallienus (AD 253–268): short hair and a full beard and moust
ache. The 
woman’s hair is wrapped around the head in three tresses with a centre  
parting. This hairstyle is typical of the S
everan Dynasty (AD 193–235). It is  
not unusual for portraits from two  
different periods to be found in the  same relief. It is well possible that it  was made after the woman’s death 
around AD 210 and that the man’s  
portrait was finished later. But it is also 
possible that the woman kept the  
hairstyle from her youth. She is wearing 
a tunic and an outer garment hanging over the right shoulder and running across the front. T
he two garments are 
hard to distinguish, but when the relief was new they were undoubtedly painted in different colours. The man’s bust is more in the foreground than the wom -
an’s. He is likewise dressed in a tunic and is wearing a soldier’s cloak or paludamentum
 over it, so he may have 
been in the military. The cloak is fas -
tened on his right shoulder with a round brooc
h or fibula. The couple’s wide eyes 
are striking; the wrinkle over his nose lends the man a grave expression. Roman sarcophagi and ashes containers were usually made in one piece. Since no remnants of a bottom plate are visible at the back of the relief plate, it was probably used to cover the burial niche or loculus. The merry picture of amorous Tritons and Nereids refers to a happy afterlife. The acanthus flower in the medallion’s foreground signifies that  
the couple passed away.

The muscular bronze man with a full beard and long curls is standing on

Aesculapius originally was a Greek

in Epidaurus and Pergamum. In the 
fourth centur
y BC his sanctuaries 
became more widely spread; in the  
century after, the cult of Aesculapius  
and his daughter Hygia (the goddess  of health—compare our word ‘hygiene’) 
was admitted into Rome. P
art of the 
practice of medicine was the so-called incubatio, a ritual in which the patient spent the night in Aesculapius’ temple, so that the god could appear in a dream to heal him or her. Such figurines of deities are often  
modelled on Greek predecessors.  
The style of this Aesculapius goes back 
to Hellenistic models from the third  
century BC. It is probably a votive  mould was heated, so that the clay was

a casting channel, bronze was cast  
into the hole thus created. Once it had 
cooled, the mould was removed and  
the statuette was ready for finishing.

tolerated as long as they weren’t regarded as 
sources of political unrest. Whereas Roman  
and Italian cultural heritage was exported on  
a relatively small scale, influence from outside  on Rome and the rest of Italy was far more  significant. This included the countryside, thanks 
to foreign slaves, for inst
ance. The religious  
phenomena they imported ranged from Celtic, German, Phoenician, Egyptian and Syrian gods with their own rituals—more or less ‘pure’
, some -
what adapted, or completely Hellenised—to  
curiosities such as the Jews’ monotheism. There 
were new creations as well: while the god Mithras, popular with soldiers, has a P
ersian name, the 
myths and symbols belonging to his cult appar -
ently were newly formed within the empire.W
ithout a doubt the most important change that 
happened during the Imperial Age was the rise  
of Christianity. At first the authorities clamped down on the new cult, since they saw it as a  
political threat—particularly because the Christians 
couldn’t accept another new phenomenon, the emperor cult. In the course of time, though,  
Christianity became a part of the religious land-
scape. Polytheists and monotheists in fact had 
muc
h in common. A good example is the fact  
that in the second century both changed from cremation to inhumation, and were using the same ceme
teries as well. The crucial difference, 
however, is expressed in the word monotheism itself: the one God of the Christians is a jealous god, so that his followers must exclude any other gods—contrary to the mostly inclusive nature of ancient polytheism—and have a missionary urge. As a consequence, the emperor’s conversion to the new religion heralded the inevitable demise  
of the old one. By then, Christianity had also spread throughout the empire: the fact that  
connectivity within the empire opened up new 
ways, literally and figuratively
, was essential to  
the success of this imperialist world religion.for priesthood. Religion was closely intertwined with politics in Rome, but it was an autonomous entity none
theless, to which politics looked for 
legitimacy. As the city came into closer contact with the Mediterranean world and the empire grew outside Italy, the religious repertoire likewise increased from which people in Italy could choose. In part this was conscious policy (as described above), in part it was a consequence of the many migrations in the growing empire: with the people moved their ideas. Many of those spreading beliefs and practices were not integrated into  
the public religion of city and empire, or only after a period of critical evaluation. But they were all "

The Serapeum was built  
in honour of the new god Serapis (a combination of Osiris, Apis, and the Greek gods Zeus and Hades).  It was Alexandria’s most imposing temple complex and held an important posi-tion well into the Roman period. After the temple’s destruction by fire, it was completely rebuilt during the reign of Commodus and Caracalla (i.e. between AD 181 and 217) and ex-tended to include the wor-ship of Zeus and Helios. The temple had a famous statue of Serapis as well  as many other sculptures  in Graeco-Roman and Egyptian style. A branch  of the great library of  Alexandria was also housed in the complex.THE GODS
The Roman emperors supported Egyptian  
temples; Augustus and Tiberius in particular had 
temples enlarged and decorated throughout the countr
y. In this respect the emperors assumed the 
role of the divine pharaoh, as the Ptolemies had done before them; the difference was that they did not reside in Egypt, nor were they crowned. Professional priests performed the prescribed  
rituals in the temples; being the keepers of  
magical knowledge in the temple libraries, they 
made a bit of money on the side as healers in  
the surrounding towns and villages.
T
emples to the Greek gods were less numerous, 
because they were connected to the presence  
of foreigners. Worship of the Roman gods even was rare in Egypt, apart from the emperor cult. F
urthermore there were a few gods from else -
where in the eastern Mediterranean region, who had been introduced by immigrants and had gained popularity with the locals. T

The Roman period in Egypt was marked by increasing competition among religions. A  
person’s religion mainly depended on his or  
her cultural background. Native Egyptians, the 
largest group, adhered to the traditional Egyptian religion with its divine kingship, countless gods and goddesses, demons, and sacred animals.  
Foreigners and their descendants often stuck  
to the gods of their land of origin. Moreover,  new religions emerged in this period: Christianity 
from the second centur
y and Manichaeism from 
the third, for instance. During the fourth century Christianity finally superseded all preceding  
religions."
