              " '11\\nEternal Egypt unfurls the fascinating history of Egypt and \\ngoes deeper than the pharaoh and mummy stereotypes.  \\nIt focuses on the long history of Egypt, from earliest prehis -\\ntory (1,600,000 BC) down to modern Coptic and Islamic times. We offer readers an overview of the rich Egyptian \\ncollection in the Allard Pierson Museum, of archaeological \\nfieldwork being conducted in Egypt by Dutch and Flemish universities, and of ancient Egyptian culture.\\nThe archaeological collection in the Museum illustrates the \\ninspiring and multifaceted history of Egypt from prehistory up to and including the early Middle Ages. Archaeological fieldwork in Egypt has resulted in surprising new perspec\\n-\\ntives for many years. Last but not least, this publication also highlights the excavations conducted by the Allard Pierson \\nMuseum for over twenty years at Tell Ibrahim Awad under \\nthe supervision of curator Willem van Haarlem.When you think of Egypt, prehistoric petroglyphs, the \\nGreek Ptolemaic Dynasty, Roman temples or Coptic \\n \\nmonasteries are not what first springs to mind. However, that \\nwill certainly change after reading this publication and visit -\\ning the accompanying exhibition. Much of the credit is due to the Netherlands-Flemish Insititute in Cairo (NVIC). The \\n \\ninnovative research that has been facilitated for years by this institute has been a fantastic and irreplaceable stimulus. \\nThe cooperation between the Allard Pierson Museum and \\nthe Netherlands-Flemish Institute has been crucial, and is \\n \\nillustrated by this publication and exhibition. We would like to express our particular thanks to director Dr Rudolph \\nde Jong and assistant director Dr Andre Veldmeijer for their \\nsupport and assistance.The publication of Eternal Egypt and the accompanying \\n \\nexhibition Eternal Egypt Experience are also the result \\nof close cooperation with the Bibliotheca Alexandrina/\\nCultnat, with the assistance of Deputy Director Mohamed \\nFarouk being of particular importance.The exhibition was compiled by Willem van Harlem, who \\ntogether with Ben van den Bercken is also responsible for \\nthe accompanying publication. This project presents the most recent insights concerning Egypt, and has gratefully made use of the research results of the excavations in Egypt conducted under the auspices of the NVIC. We would like \\nto warmly thank Dr Dirk Huyge (Qurta and El-Kab), Wil\\n-\\nlem van Haarlem (Tell Ibrahim Awad) , Prof. Harco Willems \\n(Deir el-Bersheh), Prof. Maarten Raven (Saqqara), Prof. Olaf \\nKaper (Dakhla/Kellis), Marie-Cécile Bruwier and Francis \\nChoël (Smouha) and Dr Karel Innemée (Deir el-Baramus), who have allowed visitors to this exhibition and readers of \\nthis publication to peek over their shoulders and share in \\nthe historical sensation of working in Egypt. Eternal Egypt is the third part of what has become \\n \\na distinct and successful series for the general public by the Allard Pierson Museum, and is published in coopera\\n-\\ntion with WBOOKS of Zwolle. The coordination of the publication was organized by Paulien Retèl and the editor \\nwas Toon Vugts. The translation into English was by Julia \\n \\nHarvey. The project coordinator for the exhibition was  \\nMarian Schilder, the design of the publication was in the \\nhands of Miriam Schlick (Extrablond) and of the exhibition \\nin those of Conita Vermeulen (m3 bouwkunst). The steer -\\ning group was chaired by Steph Scholten, director of UvA \\nErfgoed. We would like to thank all of them for their contri -\\nbution to the realization of the publication and exhibition. This project was made possible with the generous support \\nof DJOSER Reizen and the Friends of the Allard Pierson \\nMuseum. The Friends assist the Museum to expand and \\n \\nrealize its ambitions, and this exhibition and publication are the tangible results of this cooperation.\\nEgypt has inspired us, and hopefully it will also inspire you. \\nEternal Egypt demonstrates that the important cultural \\n \\nheritage of Egypt is irrevocably intertwined with European cultural history. \\nDr Wim Hupperetz\\nDirector of the Allard Pierson MuseumForeword ',\n",

              " '17prEHistoriC EgyptThe first hominids entered Egypt about 300,000 years \\nago. They settled along the fertile banks of the river Nile.  \\nBetween 56 and 35 million years ago there was a ‘Proto-Nile’ that flowed through the Western Desert and formed \\nthe basis for the present-day Nile. The Proto-Nile and the \\nNile have gradually shifted towards the east. As a result, any traces left by habitation by the earliest humans on the east \\nbank have most likely been obliterated.\\nThe Nile probably acquired its current form at the start of the Pliocene Era (5.5 to 2.5 million years ago). The river is \\nfed by smaller rivers – the Atbara, the White Nile (linking it \\n \\nto Lake Victoria) and the Blue Nile (linking it to Lake Tana) – \\nand inundated regularly due to meltwaters from the moun -\\ntain ranges of Central Africa. This periodic inundation re -\\nsulted in the deposition of fertile silt, but the Nile could also wash earth out of the valley. The river eroded a passage into \\nthe landscape, creating higher areas or terraces. These play \\nan important role in the archaeological hunt for the first in\\n-\\nhabitants of the Nile Valley. Just past Cairo, the Nile divides into a number of branches that debouch into the Mediterra\\n-\\nnean Sea, creating the Nile Delta. This is a fertile region that changed regularly as a result of the drying up and shifting of \\nthe river branches, as well as through the creation of new \\nbranches. Just as today, there were oases in Pharaonic Egypt. The best \\nknown is the Fayum Oasis. This low-lying region in the \\n \\ndesert is delimited on its north side by a steep cliff and \\ngradu ally rises towards the south. The Fayum is fed by a \\nbranch of the Nile that splits off at about the level of current-day El Ashmunein. This oasis was an important agricultural area, particularly during the Middle Kingdom and the Grae\\n-\\nco-Roman periods. A number of oases are located in the Western Desert, parallel to the Nile – Siwa, Bahariya, Fara\\n-\\nfra, Dakhla, Kharga and Selima. These oases, too, are often  \\ndelimited on their north side by a steep cliff and gradu -\\nally rise towards the south. However, unlike the Fayum, they are not fed by river water but by artesian wells – places \\nwhere the groundwater is pushed up through the surface.\\nLower Palaeolithic (1,600,000\\xad248,000 BC) \\nThere were people in the Nile Valley in the Early Palaeo -\\nlithic Period. This is proved by the discovery of flint tools \\ndating to about 298,000 BC. This period is characterized \\nby the production and use of bifacial tools – flint tools \\nworked on two sides. They can probably be attributed to the hominid Homo erectus, the first humans who walked fully \\n \\nupright. The theory is that Homo erectus trekked through the region as a hunter-gatherer. The tools that have been in the middle palaeolithic, flint blades were manufactured  \\non a major scale using the levallois technique – a develop-\\nment of a technique used in a slightly different way already \\nin the early palaeolithic. several blades could be struck from \\nlarge flint cores. Just like a swiss army knife, they could be \\nused for anything and everything, and sometimes even  \\nreworked into a different tool. These blades have a triangular \\nprofile and a flat back. Height: 7 and 9.67 cm.\\nmicroliths (lit. small stones) are first found in egypt in the \\nlate palaeolithic. These small, sharp flints were often made \\nby splitting up larger flint blades. They could then be worked \\nas required to make even sharper edges. microliths could be \\nused as arrowheads, or as part of a larger tool, for example by setting them into a wooden shaft. These examples were \\nfound at late palaeolithic/early neolithic temporary sites in \\nthe Fayum oasis. Heights between 2.2 and 3.4 cm.',\n",

This is because either this material \\nwas not preserved, or the original archaeological sites were \\nwashed away or covered by the Nile.It is difficult to say how many of these early Palaeolithic \\nsites there are, or how they are distributed through the \\nlandscape. In Egypt we know of sites near Luxor and close to Nag Ahmed el-Khalifa (c. 298,000 BC). Similar finds have \\nbeen made in Sudan at a few higher-lying rock formations. \\nAt site Arkin-8 in North Sudan, tools made from local flint have been found, as well as sandstone blocks that are placed \\nin such a way that they might have formed part of a building. \\nIn the Wadi Halfa region, researchers were able to differen\\n-\\ntiate between flint tools from several periods. This was also where the oldest known tools with traces of what is known \\nas the Levallois technique have been found. This is a special \\nknapping technique for flint that only later became fully de\\n-\\nveloped. The technique involves a flint core being prepared along its edges, resulting in a shape reminiscent of a tortoise \\nshell. A large flake can then be struck from this tortoise core. \\nThis flake is immediately usable as a tool, for example a knife. In the Western Desert, tools have been found in Dakhla and \\nKharga oases (c. 298,000-248,000 BC) and near old, dried-\\nout wells. The hominids who used these tools lived in a cli\\n-\\nmate that was much moister and where the oases and wells were numerous. \\nMiddle Palaeolithic (248,000\\xad38,000 BC)\\nIn the early Middle Palaeolithic period, it became more arid in Egypt. Wells in the Western Desert dried up and the Nile \\nbegan to flow more slowly. The groups of hunter-gatherers \\nwere forced to move closer to water sources such as the Nile   This rectangular stone chisel was found in the Fayum \\noasis. it is made of a large flint flake and is worked on \\nall sides. such tools are regularly found with axes, dou-\\nble-edged knives, arrowheads and pottery in the West-\\nern desert.

During the Middle Pal -\\naeolithic there were also wetter periods when the groups \\ncould move to the temporary oases. At about this time the \\nhominids were using bifacial tools, and often tools made us -\\ning the Levallois technique. Most of the sites we know about \\nare in the Western Desert. This is where the groups of peo -\\nple gathered different kinds of plants and hunted animals, from hare and wildcat to gazelle and giraffe. There are also \\ncaves with traces of hearths found on the Red Sea coast near \\nthe Eastern Desert, so groups of hominids must have lived in this area too. In the Nile Valley, however, we only have \\ntraces of flint quarrying on the Nile terraces from this pe\\n-\\nriod. The sites that were occupied were probably closer to \\nthe river and are now covered by thick layers of Nile silt.\\nIn around 98,000 BC the climate again became drier, and \\nagain the people were forced into the Nile Valley. In the subsequent Taramsa Hill phase (88,000-33,000 BC), peo\\n-\\nple made flint flakes using the Levallois technique on a large scale. This technique enabled them to get several long flakes \\nfrom a single core, each with a clear point and a triangular \\nprofile. This phase has also produced the oldest known \\n \\nburial of an anatomically ‘modern human’ (c. 53,000 BC), found near Taramsa Hill. Shafts dug by hunter-gatherers to \\nquarry flint for their tools have also been found there. In Su\\n-\\ndan, near the site Khor Musa, tools have been found associ -\\nated with charcoal and the bones of aurochs, gazelle, fowl \\nand fish. Further to the north, human remains have also \\nbeen found in the Wadi Kubbaniya. \\nIt is difficult to draw up a chronology for the Mid-Palaeolith -\\nic based on the different types of tools. The finds that have been made mainly prove that flint was mined. Several dif\\n-\\nferent assemblages (large quantities together) of flint tools ',\n",

The first traces of humans found \\n \\nthus far date to the end of the early palaeolithic period and come from \\nthe nile Valley. This could be proof \\nthat hominids in this period had to \\nstay close to the edges of the water \\n(nile and oases) to survive. At any rate, they continued to apply this \\nstrategy in the following millennia. \\nduring the middle palaeolithic, the upper palaeolithic and the late \\n \\npalaeolithic periods, the shifting of the southern monsoon border and \\nthe northern mediterranean border \\nresulted in periods of arid and wet \\nclimates alternating with each other. \\neven during these periods there could be significant shifts in tempe-\\nrature. The climate changes in the \\nsouth affected the flow of the nile, but rain brought to the Western \\n variety of animals and plants. long ago in egypt and sudan, elephants, \\ngiraffes and ostriches used to wander \\naround. With the passage of time, however, these animals began to \\n \\nappear only much further to the south. Humans, animals and plants \\nadapted to the climate and a fragile \\nbalance was achieved with the \\n \\nimmediate environment. After the last wet period in about 6,000-5,000 \\nBC, the climate became drier and \\nhas remained arid down to the \\n \\npresent day. in the meantime,  \\nthe groups of people learned to  \\nmanipulate their environment by  \\ndomesticating animals and plants,  \\nso that despite the aridity they  \\ncould live perma nently in the  \\nnile Valley.desert changed it into a steppe  \\nregion. As the water levels in the nile rose \\ndue to the monsoon rains in the \\nsouth, the inundation plain was no longer always inhabitable, and the \\npeople shifted their settlements to \\nthe edges of the nile Valley. Wadis, seasonal waterways that became \\n \\npermanently dry later on, contained a lot of water during the wet periods, \\n \\nthus creating large expanses of green, habitable areas, for example \\nthe Wadi Kubbaniya and the Wadi \\nHalfa. The groundwater levels in many areas must also have been \\nmuch higher, with artesian wells and \\nalso playas (seasonal lakes) offering groups of humans a means of survival.\\nClimate change also influenced the ClimatE and ClimatE CHangE\\nduring the arid periods in egyptian prehistory, the savannah-like Western desert  \\nbecame a dry sandy expanse, as seen here at saqqara. survival was virtually impossi-\\nble.

During \\nthe Late Palaeolithic, different groups of people (cultures) \\ncan be differentiated on the basis of the flint tool assem -\\nblages. In the period 19,000-13,000 BC, they mainly com -\\nprised small blades and microliths – small flint tools only a few centimeters long. Microliths could be made by splitting \\nlong blades up into smaller parts, but they could also be sim\\n-\\nple small flakes. This technique enabled optimum use to be \\nmade of the flint – every flake was used.\\nIn the dry river beds, called wadis, water remained stand -\\ning in temporary lakes. They were often a rich source of \\nflora and fauna, which encouraged people to remain in their  \\nvicinity. In the Wadi Kubbaniya and at the site Makhad -\\nma-4, for example, fish were caught on a large scale. The fish were trapped in small pools and lakes in the wadi after the \\ninundation receded. At the sites Makhadma-2 and Makhad\\n-\\nma-4 (c. 10,450-10,050 BC), the fish were not only caught \\non a large scale but also preserved by being smoked. It thus \\nappears that people were laying in food reserves for the  \\nperiods when there was less food available. In addition to fish \\nbones, the bones of aurochs, hartebeest (a kind of antelope) \\nand gazelle have been found there. In the Wadi Kubbaniya, \\nthe oldest known millstones have been found in large num -\\nbers. The inhabitants of the Nile Valley thus adapted to their changed environment. The creation of food reserves reveals \\nthat from about 10,000 BC there must have been changes \\nin the way food was shared among the group and thus also in the mutual social relationships. This was the first step on \\nthe way to a more permanent, sedentary way of life and an \\nincrease in the population in the Nile Valley.At the end of the Late Palaeolithic, the climate again became \\nwetter and floods occurred. From this period, known as the \\n‘wild Nile’ stage (11,000-10,000 BC), and that immediately following (10,000-6,000 BC), graves have been found that \\nreveal that the dead were buried in line with certain cus\\n-\\ntoms. For example, at Gebel Sahaba (c. 10,000 BC) the dead \\nwere buried on their left sides in a flexed position and fac -\\ning south. The burial pits were then covered with sandstone slabs. Some of the people buried here seem to have died a \\nnatural death, but many of the others appear to have been \\ndeliberately killed. This is indicated by finds of bones with flint points embedded in them and with cut marks. It is pos\\n-\\nsible that these people were killed in conflict with another group. During the ‘wild Nile’ stage, people lived closer to \\neach other because the Nile Valley was mainly under water.\\nIn general, it is assumed that the Nile Valley was sparsely populated in the period 10,000-6,000 BC. We also know have been found dating to the Middle Palaeolithic. This could mean that at that time there were different groups of people or cultures in the Nile Valley. \\nUpper Palaeolithic (38,000\\xad22,000 BC)\\nThe extreme aridity during the Upper Palaeolithic forced the groups of humans to stay close to water sources such \\nas the Nile and the Oases. This period is the first in which \\nHomo sapiens sapiens turns up in Egypt. The flint technolo\\n-\\ngies from the late Middle Palaeolithic were continued, but flint was being worked more and more efficiently. There \\nis now little waste product, and a high quality level was \\nreached when working it.In Nazlet Khater-4 in Middle Egypt, two graves have been \\nfound with Homo Sapiens. They contain the oldest known \\nburial goods in Egypt – in one grave was a bifacial axe and in the other a human foetus and ostrich eggs. These graves \\nlie close to a place where flint was mined. The people dug \\nholes and underground tunnels to get to the deeper-lying flint. This is an example of one of the earliest known under\\n-\\nground mining techniques in the world.There are few sites known in Egypt dating to the Upper \\n \\nPalaeolithic. Cultures such as the Shuwikhatian and Hal -\\nfan cultures are representative of this period. Longer blades were created using the Levallois technique. \\nLate Palaeolithic (19,000 – c. 6,000 BC)\\nMany Late Palaeolithic sites have been found in the south -\\nern Nile valley. During this period the climate remained very arid. As a result, the Nile retracted in its bed and \\n Birket Qarun, the lake in the Fayum oasis, had different  \\nwater levels through time.

One ex -\\nplanation is that there were so many natural food sources in the Nile Valley that there was no need or pressure to adapt \\nthe old fishing, hunting, gathering way of life. This process \\nonly began with the arid phase at the start of the Middle \\n \\nNeolithic period. The inhabitants of the Western Desert were then once more forced into the Nile Valley.\\nThere are many traces of habitation in the Western Desert \\nfrom the period 6,500-4,700 BC. There were two types of habitation site – settlement sites and what are called task \\nsites, places where people went for short periods, for exam\\n-\\nple to excavate flints, catch fish or track herds of wild animals. \\nAt the settlement sites, traces have been found of buildings \\nthat were reinforced with stone, as well as the remains of \\nbuildings made of mud and wood. During the Early Neo -\\nlithic period, blades were slowly replaced by simple flakes that during this wetter period, people once again occupied the oases of the Western Desert. This is also the period \\nwhen the first rock art appears on high ground such as Abka \\nin Sudan, and in Egypt in the Wadi Abu Subeira and in El Hosh and Qurta. The carved and scratched petroglyphs \\nshow images of cattle, humans and fishtraps. \\nNeolithic period (8,800\\xad4,700 BC) \\nThe wetter period continued on into the Neolithic period, \\nresulting in the Western Desert developing a permanent \\npopulation. Just like the people in the Nile Valley in later \\nperiods, they first tended herds of domesticated animals and used pottery. These are two of the most important charac\\n-\\nteristics of Neolithic cultures.The periodic rains and inundations forced the groups to \\nmove around, whereby they populated the oases of the \\nWestern Desert during the inundation season. Nabta Playa and Bir Kiseiba are the best known sites from the early Neo\\n-\\nlithic period (8,800-6,800 BC). At Bir Kiseiba, asemblages of flint have been found that include microliths. The inhab\\n-\\nitants kept cattle, but also hunted hare and gazelle. The old -\\nest known pottery also dates from this period. They are sim -\\nple forms, mainly dishes, decorated with dotted lines and  \\npatterns that appear to have been scratched into the clay with a comb. The remains of simple huts and storage pits, \\npossibly for food, have been found near Nabta Playa, and \\nmust have been located on the banks of a lake.Although the Neolithic period had begun in the Western \\nDesert, the people living in the Nile Valley were still follow\\n-\\ning a Late Palaeolithic lifestyle. These groups of people con -\\ntinued to hunt, fish and gather. Two sites are known in the \\nNile Valley from this period. At the first, El-Kab in Middle \\nEgypt, the people lived on the banks of the Nile. They fished \\nin pools left after the inundation season, but also in the Nile itself, which indicates that they must have had boats. They \\nhunted animals that lived in the nearby wadi regions, for \\nexample gazelle and Barbary sheep. Just as in the Western Desert, microliths were used for hunting and fishing. In the \\nEastern Desert, on the other side of the Nile, traces have \\nbeen found that are comparable to those at El-Kab, which might indicate that these people too were nomadic hunters \\ntied to the seasons. However, the oldest traces of domesti\\n-\\ncated sheep and goats come from this region (c. 6,000-5,500 \\nBC). They were found near Quseir, where the settlements \\nhave been labelled Neolithic for this reason. The second \\nsite in the Nile Valley where the Late Palaeolithic way of life continued was the Fayum Oasis (from about 8,100 BC). \\nHere, too, fish were an important part of the diet, and hunt\\n-red polished squat jars such as this one mainly come from \\nburial contexts.

              " 'eternal egypt24 Badarian sites (4,400\\xad4,000 BC) \\nThe Badarian culture of Middle Egypt reveals the first clues \\nthat agriculture was also being practised further to the south \\nin Egypt. A few sites between Matmar and Hemamia com -\\nprise settlements and cemeteries that together form the \\nheart of the area covered by this culture. The sites can cer -\\ntainly be dated to the period 4,400-4,000 BC, but may be even older. The Badarian culture found here is a mixture of \\nweak influences from the Nile Valley and strong influences \\nfrom the Western Desert. The graves at these sites reveal that there were people of varying status living here – some were \\ngiven more burial goods than others. The pottery found \\nin the graves is very similar to that of the later Predynastic Naqada culture – small bowls and cups of a brownish colour, \\nwith a rippled surface and sometimes a black, polished rim. \\nThis pottery was used to store grain, among other things. Just as at Merimde Beni-Salame, there were simple houses \\nof wattle and daub. Animal shelters have been found, too, \\nidentified by the animal excrement. Various objects have been found in the settlements – bifacial flint tools, copper \\nbeads, hairpins and combs made of bone, bracelets, cosmetic \\npalettes and female figurines made of ivory and bone.The remains of the Badarian culture have not just been \\nfound in that region. Further to the south, in Hierakonpolis, \\nDendara, Armant and the Wadi Hammamat, similar mate\\n-\\nrial has also been found. In the Eastern Desert, too, and in the coastal regions of the Red Sea, traces of the Badarian \\nculture have been found. In turn, shells that were trans\\n-\\nported via the Eastern Desert have been found in graves in \\nthe Nile Valley. It is thus certain that there must have been \\ncontact between these regions. The Badarian culture also \\nhas strong similarities with the Naqada culture further to the south. That culture would play an important role in the \\nearly Pharaonic civilization (from c. 4,000 BC), a sedentary \\nsociety with a hierarchical system. and notched arrowheads. The pottery was decorated with ever more complicated patterns up to about 5,100 BC. From about 4,900 BC, this was gradually replaced by polished red \\npottery, for example at Nabta Playa, Bir Kiseiba and in the \\nDakhla Oasis. In Nabta Playa, in the period 5,100-4,700 BC, the first public architecture was constructed. Huge rocks \\nwere assembled around the burial of a bull. Close by, smaller \\nstones were set up, perhaps to be used as a star chart. People would have to have worked together to achieve these pro\\n-\\njects, which is an indication that social relationships were becoming more complex. After about 4,400 BC, the West\\n-\\nern Desert developed the climate that we know today.In the Nile Valley, a lot changed in around 5,100 BC. In the \\nFayum Oasis, the Fayumian culture developed (5,450-4,400 \\nBC). This resembled the cultures from the Western Desert much more than those from the Nile Valley. It is possible \\nthat groups of people from the desiccating Western Desert \\nhad moved to the Fayum Oasis. Sites in that region have \\n \\nrevealed subterranean grain silos and traces of domesticated plants, including wheat and flax. These domesticated plants \\nwere possibly introduced via the Nile Delta from the Near \\nEast. The arrival of the people from the Western Desert meant that there were food shortages. This was resolved \\nfrom 6,200 BC on by the large-scale cultivation of plants. \\nAlongside agriculture, animal husbandry and fishing were the most important food sources. We also see the first do\\n-\\nmesticated sheep and goats in the Fayum Oasis. There was also trade – sites from the Late Neolithic period regularly \\ncontain objects that were probably acquired through con\\n-\\ntact with regions further away, for example shells and stone \\npalettes used to apply cosmetics. \\nMerimde Beni-Salame is an important site from the Late \\nNeolithic period. The bones of domesticated sheep, cattle, pigs and goats have been found here in the oldest archaeo\\n-\\nlogical layers (c. 4,800 BC). Pottery has been found in the more recent layers of the site, as well as figurines of bone \\nand ivory. This site has also revealed a short street of oval \\nhouses made of wattle and daub. Each house had its own storage silo, hearth, millstone and waterpot. The sites of the \\nEl Omari culture (named after the discoverer and dated to \\n4,600-4,350 BC) reveal a similar material culture. In the re\\n-\\ngion around Luxor and in Sudan, pottery now appears for the first time.

This has been the way for thousands of years.The Pre\\xad\\ndynastic and Early Dynastic Periods\\nthe predynastic period\\nIn the winter of 1894-1895, the distinguished British  \\narchaeologist William Matthew Flinders Petrie made a puz -\\nzling discovery in Naqada, in Upper Egypt. He found a large \\narea full of graves whose contents were completely differ -\\nent to anything excavated before in Egypt – vases decorated with all kinds of figures, red pottery with their upper halves \\nblack, cosmetic palettes and mace heads. This was so dif\\n-\\nferent to what had been found thus far that Petrie initially \\njumped to the conclusion that they must have been the \\ngraves of immigrants and not of indigenous Egyptians. It \\nsoon turned out that there was a much simpler explanation – they were the material remains of the earliest Egyptians \\nknown up till then. When he later discovered more such \\ngraves not far away, he had enough material to try to place it into the right chronological order. To do so, he developed a \\nbrilliant statistical system which he called Sequence Dating. \\nAs he expected that a different method or more data would give his finds absolute dates, he used the method as a rela\\n-\\ntive dating system.Petrie’s system mainly depended on the development \\n \\nundergone by certain pottery shapes. For example, he saw  \\na development over time in the changes to pottery with wavy handles – first they had functional handles, later on only a \\ndecorative wavy line in shallow relief. The system remained \\nin use for a long time, until better dating methods were \\n \\ndeveloped. One of these is C14 dating, which measures the decay over time of an instable form of carbon, thus enabling \\nan absolute date to be established for organic material.When exactly did the Predynastic Period start in Egypt, and \\nwhen did prehistory stop? The answer to this question is still being vigorously discussed, and is thus arbitrary up to \\na certain point. This book will follow the most commonly \\naccepted terminology and chronology. This means that we view the Predynastic Period as starting in 4000 BC with \\nwhat is called Naqada I, after the site where the material was \\ndiscovered.\\nNaqada I (4000\\xad3500 BC)\\nThe increasingly arid climate, a process that started in the prehistoric period, forced the population more and more \\ninto the Nile Valley. The agriculture that had emerged in the \\npreceding Neolithic period was now the definitive means of existence, and the many separate cultures that started before \\nthat time now slowly began to evolve into a more coherent \\nwhole. The combination of increased population density in the Nile Valley and the slow drying out of the surrounding \\nareas resulted in increasing isolation – a precondition for the \\ndevelopment of an independent and social culture relatively undisturbed by outside influences. One drawback for this \\nperiod is that much more archaeological research has been \\nconducted in cemeteries than in settlement sites. This is be\\n-\\ncause people preferred to bury their dead in locations at the edge of the desert so that they did not have to use valuable ',\n",
              " '30\\neternal egypt\\nfertile land. As a result, such cemeteries are easy to localize \\nand to investigate. Settlements, on the other hand, were in \\nthe fertile valley and were regularly replaced by later settle -\\nments, making them much harder to access. They also left \\nfar fewer remains, as the constructions in which they lived \\nwere mainly made of wood and reeds, material that leaves \\nfar fewer traces than stone or mudbrick. One of the few properly investigated sites is located at Hierakonpolis, far \\nto the south. During this period and the one following it, \\n \\nHierakonpolis developed into an important economic and \\nadministrative centre. The houses were varied, with not \\nonly reeds, palm tree trunks and wood being used, but also \\nmud, not yet in the form of separate bricks, but applied lay -er by layer in a way that you still encounter in Egypt. The fences for domesticated animals were also constructed in \\nthis way. This may be due to the equally varied socioeco\\n-\\nnomic circumstances. Part of the population was still semi-  \\nnomadic, with the herders of flocks of sheep, goats and  \\ncattle visiting the available meadows in tune with the  \\nseasons – a bit like the Bedouin of the Nile Delta still do  \\ntoday. Another part was more settled, and cultivated barley, \\nwheat, flax and fruits. Hunting for gazelle, ostrich and hip -\\npopotamus remained an important food source, as did fish -\\ning. The desertification was not yet complete, so there were still many different types of animals that can now only be \\nfound in the plains of East Africa. Much less material from \\nNaqada I and II has been found in the Nile Delta than in the Nile Valley, but nevertheless it is possible to see differences. \\nThe excavated settlement site of Merimde Beni Salame in \\nthe Western Delta is the main source of this information. Here, the graves of the dead were found between the hous\\n-\\nes, not in a separate cemetery. This appears to be relatively common in the Delta, even in later times.\\nMany different types of graves may indicate social strata and \\nperhaps even religious tendencies. A small number of graves were rich in burial goods, while the majority were signifi\\n-\\ncantly less well provisioned. What is particularly noticeable is the role of mace heads, whose wooden handles have often \\nrotted away. In some of the richer burials, these functioned \\nas symbols of the power of the deceased. Mace heads would play this role for a very long time to come. Apparently a sort \\nof leader class began to develop, as yet with only limited \\npower. New elements such as population increase and con\\n-\\ncentration, and permanent settlements instead of the usual moving around, worked in favour of this trend. The discov\\n-\\nery of a model of a defensive wall with sentry posts suggests that this process was not conflict-free – even more reason \\nto form population concentrations under secure conditions, \\nfor example villages with ramparts.\\nNaqada II (3500\\xad3200 BC)\\nThis phase began in around 3500 BC. Unlike the preced -\\ning period, remains from Naqada II have been found over a much wider area, including the Eastern Delta and Nubia. \\nThere also appears to have been more contact between the \\ndifferent parts of the country, and even with abroad. Proper urban centres arose at Naqada and Hierakonpolis, unlike the \\nsmaller settlements of Naqada I. The settlements were also \\ncloser to the Nile, probably as a result of the further aridifi\\n-\\ncation of the surrounding areas. The increased numbers are also an indication of population growth.

Towards the end of this period, the first three of \\nthese power centres formed what would later develop into \\na sort of Upper Egyptian proto-kingdom. When this state gradually began to expand to the south and the north, unifi\\n-\\ncation of the country became a realistic option.Hunting now plays a lesser role in food provision, which was becoming more and more efficient. The first indications \\nof small-scale irrigation played a part in this. One impor\\n-\\ntant consequence was the significant increase in handmade \\nproducts, both in numbers and in variety. This means that \\npart of the population was no longer involved in contribut -\\ning to food production and was able to concentrate on be -\\ncoming expert at making these products.

The most important piece is called the Paler -\\nmo Stone, after its current location – the Archaeological Museum in Palermo, Sicily, where it ended up at the end of \\nthe 19th century.

Most of the written and \\niconographic sources known thus far, however, come from \\nHierakonpolis, which was not much less important than Abydos, even though it was not the necropolis or the resi\\n-\\ndence of the kings. The most important god of the time, the falcon-god Horus, came from Hierakonpolis.

For the time being the \\npharaohs continued to be buried in the traditional necropo -\\nlis at Abydos, while at the same time cenotaphs were built for them in the new necropolis of Saqqara, on the desert \\nplateau opposite Memphis, as symbols of the single entity \\nthat Egypt was from that time on.

That their original roles \\nwere fetish and totem animals is the most plausible explanation. Traces \\n \\nof them can still be seen in the em -\\nblems of the individual nomes, which remained in use throughout the en\\n-\\ntire history of ancient egypt. most  \\nof the many gods we know from  \\nancient egypt are local, as a result  \\nof the geographical divisions of the country. during naqada i it appears \\nthat the bull and the cow played a \\nmajor role, judging by the iconogra\\n-\\nphy on vases and in sculpture. From that moment on, the dead were no \\nlonger buried in a stellar orientation, \\nbut aligned with the nile. This could have a religious meaning – there are \\nindications of a star cult, and we \\nmeet clear traces of this in the later pyramid Texts. \\nAs a result of the political union, \\n \\nwe first see what could be termed \\ncross-border national gods emerg -\\ning. The victors brought their own gods with them, such as the falcon \\ngod Horus of triumphant Hierakon\\n-\\npolis, but not necessarily at the cost \\nof local gods.

He may perhaps have organized military ex\\n-\\npeditions to the Sinai and Palestine. Djer’s tomb complex reveals striking changes and innovations when compared \\nto the constructions of his predecessors. The tomb itself is \\nrectangular, with a thick outer wall and niches. It is not pos\\n-\\nsible to reconstruct what it originally looked like, because the tomb was later regarded as the tomb of Osiris and rebuilt \\nwith that idea in mind. Luckily a mummified arm of the king, \\nwith bracelets, was overlooked – it’s now one of the earliest \\nknown examples of mummification. Rows of storage cham\\n-\\nbers were built on three sides of the central burial chamber. \\nClose by were several rows of smaller tombs, apparently \\nfor the royal harem ladies, among others. One unexpected \\nphenomenon was the discovery of a large number of small \\ntombs dating to Djer’s reign. They are somewhat removed \\nfrom his tomb, and laid out in a large rectangle, facing the Nile Valley. They were probably situated on the four sides \\nof a now vanished mudbrick enclosure wall, within which \\nburial rites were probably conducted and where a mortuary temple may have been situated.

During his reign, mineral \\nexploration in the Sinai started on a grand scale for the first \\ntime. Djoser is mainly renowned for his famous Step Pyra -\\nmid complex at Saqqara, which replaced Abydos as the royal necropolis from that time on. In the complex, architectural \\ndevelopments from the previous period are brought togeth\\n-\\ner to form a new kind of burial monument.\\nThe Step Pyramid itself started off as a single mastaba tomb, \\nbut was extended in a series of stages with ever-smaller \\nmastabas on top of it, finally forming five ‘steps’. The royal tomb is beneath this monument. The remains of a mortuary \\ntemple can be seen on the north side. The pyramid forms \\nthe centrepiece of a huge rectangular complex, surrounded by an enclosure wall. All kinds of elements from the palace \\nof the living king can be found here, in durable limestone in\\n-\\nstead of mudbrick, wood and reeds – after all, the tomb was \\nsupposed to last for ever. In addition, it was to be a symbol \\nof the unity of the country, which is why elements of both \\nnorthern and southern palace architecture were included. There was also a separate area for the ritual run of the king \\nduring his heb-sed jubilee celebrations (see Chapter 2). The \\nstory goes that the complex was designed by the doctor/\\n \\narchitect Imhotep, who was deified much later on in  \\nhistory. It dominated the necropolis of Saqqara for a long  \\ntime, because many later tombs were built around it. \\nDjoser died before his tomb complex was completed. His \\nson and successor Sekhemkhet ruled for such a short time \\nthat a similar tomb complex started by him near that of his father had hardly even begun to take shape when he died.\\nThe identification and order of a number of subsequent \\npharaohs is by no means yet secure; even the location of their tombs is uncertain. Only when we come to Huni, \\nprobably the last pharaoh of this dynasty, do we know a bit \\nmore. What is remarkable about him is that no clear tomb has been found, instead a series of small step pyramids \\nspread over all of Upper Egypt. It is possible that they were \\nsymbols of the centralized power of the king and designed to strengthen the position of the pharaoh, but this is by no \\nmeans certain.\\n4th Dynasty (2639\\xad2504 BC)\\nThe most impressive monuments from Egyptian history \\nwere built during the 4th Dynasty. Pharaoh Snofru, the  \\nfirst of the dynasty, started the trend. He was married to Hetepheres, a daughter of Huni. We don’t know much more \\nabout him than that he organized trading expeditions to the \\nSinai and the Lebanon.Snofru built two, and perhaps even three pyramids. The \\nBent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid at Dahshur can certain\\n-\\nly be attributed to him, and it is possible that he was also  \\nresponsible for the unfinished (?) pyramid at Meidum –  \\nalthough this one could have been started by Huni and only \\nfinished by Snofru. Why Snofru left behind no fewer than \\nthree pyramids is unclear, although they could be regarded as \\nvisible proof of a practical course in ‘How to build a pyramid’.The oldest of his pyramids is the one at Meidum, which ',\n",

This deity would play an important role for sev\\n-\\neral pharaohs of the dynasty. Although we know very little \\nabout their reigns, we do know that they paid just as much \\nattention to building sun temples as to building pyramids. \\nThe first pharaoh of the dynasty was Userkaf, possibly a grandson of Djedefre via another branch of the family. He \\ndivided his resources over two huge construction projects. \\nThis is probably why his pyramid, located just outside the Djoser complex at Saqqara, is of modest dimensions (no \\nmore than 50 metres high) and built of small irregular lime\\n-\\nstone blocks. Userkaf built his sun temple some distance to \\nthe north at Abusir. The temple comprised a platform with \\na large obelisk as a solar symbol on top, and a large valley \\ntemple linked to the obelisk temple by a ceremonial way. His son, Sahure, built his pyramid at Abusir, but does not \\nseem to have built a sun temple. All the pyramids at Abusir \\nare built close together, and it is notable that the royal mor\\n-\\ntuary temples of this dynasty gradually increased in size. Neferirkare, brother and successor to Sahure, returned to \\nthe step pyramid form for his pyramid. The second-last \\nking of the dynasty, Nyusserre, built not only a pyramid Snofru’s three pyramids together have a greater volume than the single gigantic one built by Kheops. The royal \\n \\narchitects had now acquired sufficient know-how to build the pyramid of Snofru’s successor, his son Kheops (the \\nGreek form of his name is Kheops). For this pyramid they \\nchose a new, more northerly location – the desert plateau of Giza near modern-day Cairo. This burial monument was \\nnever surpassed in the entire history of Egypt. The exten\\n-\\nsive complex included a number of long trenches around \\nthe pyramid, some of which still contain the mortuary boats \\nof Lebanese cedar which were to transport Kheops in the  \\nafterlife. Three smaller pyramids close by were intended for \\nKheops’s queens, and a huge field of mastabas was created \\nfor his courtiers literally in the shadow of his pyramid. One \\nof those tombs stands out – a richly furnished underground space for the Queen Mother Hetepheres, but with a com\\n-\\npletely empty alabaster sarcophagus – a mystery that has not yet been solved.\\nOf the reign of Kheops, like that of his father, we only know \\nof a few expeditions to the north-east; both were probably too busy building to worry about other matters. His reign \\nlasted a long time – which was lucky, otherwise the pyra\\n-\\nmid could not have been completed. As far as we know no \\nslaves were employed in the construction, they seem to \\nhave been well-cared-for workmen. Nevertheless, Kheops \\nacquired a reputation later as a bad and cruel ruler, recorded among others by the Greek historian Herodotus in his book \\non Egypt. For example, according to Herodotus Kheops \\n \\nallegedly prostituted his daughter to finance the construc -\\ntion of the pyramid.\\nKheops was succeeded by his son Djedefra for a short time. \\nThe only thing we know of him is that he started to build \\na pyramid at Abu Roash, some kilometres to the north of Giza, of which only the initial stages were completed. \\n \\nHe was succeeded by his brother Khefren (Khephren).

From there,  \\na procession moved up a covered \\nceremonial way towards the mortuary \\ntemple at the base of the pyramid for \\nthe last rites, after which the pharaoh was interred in a burial chamber in or \\nunder the pyramid. in the 4th dynas\\n-\\nty these complexes were not yet  \\ndecorated with texts and reliefs, but \\nin later dynasties this became more \\nand more common, with high quality \\nreliefs everywhere in the complex, \\nnot only in the pyramid.

We know little of his background; he may have been the vizier \\nunder the last king of the previous dynasty. He may not have \\nbeen undisputed in the early part of his reign as he was im\\n-\\nmediately faced with internal unrest and problems on the eastern and southern borders, which he dealt with very \\ncompetently.

The new city, called Itjtawy, has not \\nyet been identified.An important innovation occurred during his reign – in his \\n20th regnal year, he made his successor, the later Sesostris \\nI, co-regent beside him on the throne. This was a sensible move, given the instability of the kingdom in the recent \\npast, and this system was followed by all the pharaohs of \\nthis dynasty, all of whom reigned for relatively long peri\\n-\\nods – which was also good for stability. In later periods, too, the coregency system was sometimes implemented.

Amenemhat I was bur -\\nied in a relatively unimpressive pyramid at Lisht, not far from Itjtawy.\\nThe pharaohs of this dynasty appear to have had a particular \\ninterest in the Fayum, an area to the west of the Nile in Mid\\n-\\ndle Egypt, around a lake fed by a branch of the Nile. They reclaimed this area for agriculture by means of irrigation \\nprojects, and many of them were buried near the Fayum.\\nSesostris I had a prosperous and long reign, despite its \\n \\ndramatic beginning. He concentrated his foreign ambitions mainly on Nubia, building a series of impressive forts deep \\ninto the south – strongholds designed to keep that country \\nunder Egypt’s control. A Nubian tribe was even employed to assist the Egyptians, the Medjay. They were included as \\na separate part of the Egyptian army and also served as a \\nkind of desert police force. A beautiful wooden model of Nubian soldiers from a tomb at Asyut in Middle Egypt bears \\nwitness to this. The Medjay kept their own weapons and \\nburial customs. Their rather unusual graves, known as Pan graves, can be found deep inside Egypt. Independent Nubia, \\ncalled Kush, was forced far to the south, where its centre was \\nthe city of Kerma. When Egypt grew weaker, the Nubians \\n \\nprofited from this and pushed back northwards, up as far as Aswan.\\nSesostris I was also responsible for building the oldest part \\nof the huge Amun temple of Karnak at Thebes. It was an era of cultural and literary highpoints. Sesostris I appointed \\nhis son Amenemhat II as his co-regent and successor long \\n \\nbefore he died and was buried at Lisht, in a pyramid similar \\nto that of his predecessor Amenemhat I.\\nUnder Amenemhat II, foreign trade contacts and diplomatic \\nrelations increased, particularly with the Phoenician port of Byblos, in present-day Lebanon, which had long been im\\n-\\nportant to Egypt due to the export of cedar wood, and with Babylon in Mesopotamia.

This is \\nwhere the entrance to the burial chamber lies, at the end of a 150-metre-long underground corridor. There were all \\nkinds of impediments to thieves along this corridor, but all \\nfor naught. Because both tombs were empty when found, it is not clear where Sesostris III was actually buried. Dahshur \\nwas of course one of the traditional cemeteries for this dy\\n-\\nnasty, and there were also some solar barks buried near his \\npyramid. However, the complex in Abydos was clearly built \\nwith great care, perhaps too much care for just a cenotaph. \\nWe know that his successor, Amenemhat III, was very ac -\\ntive in the mining region in the Sinai.

What is new is that part of the country, particularly \\nthe eastern Nile Delta, was occupied by a foreign power. Im -\\nmigrants from Syria-Palestine had previously settled there \\non a limited scale, but they now became independent of the \\nEgyptian throne. They were known as the Hyksos (‘rulers \\nof foreign lands’) and took advantage of the divisions and related weakness of Egypt during the 15th Dynasty. What \\nmay also have contributed to the success of the Hyksos were \\ntheir better quality bronze weapons, the bows that shot fur\\n-\\nther, and above all the war chariots drawn by horses. Until the arrival of these Asiatics, horses had been a very rare sight \\nin Egypt; however, horses were so important to the Hyksos \\nthat they were buried close to their own tombs. The Hyksos were based at Avaris (today’s Tell el-Dab’a) in the eastern \\nDelta. Their rulers had Semitic names such as Yakub-her \\nand Khyan, and they brought their own culture and reli\\n-\\ngion with them, which not long afterwards began to absorb Egyptian influences. At a certain point in time, the Hyksos \\nrulers even took Egyptian names.\\nFor the native Egyptians, still holding on to power in the south, the presence of the Hyksos was a thorn in their side. \\nBecause the Egyptians did not simply want to give in to the \\npresence of foreign rulers in their country, the Hyksos felt obliged to expand their sphere of influence towards the south.

A nice example of this is \\n \\nthe request by the queen-widow  \\nof Tutankhamun to the king of the Hittites to send her one of his sons \\n \\nto become the successor to the throne.\\nClosely related to this is the phenom\\n-\\nenon of ‘royal incest’. it is not correct \\nto think that incest was common in \\negypt, as is sometimes thought.  \\nThe king was different to ordinary \\nfolk – he functioned as a link be -\\ntween them and the world of the gods so different rules and laws \\n \\napplied to him and his family. The idea was to keep the royal blood \\n \\nas pure as possible without any  \\ncontamination from outside, an idea not unique to egypt.

He changed his own name to Akhenaten (‘Living Spirit of the \\nAten’) and closed down many of the traditional temples \\nin order to make the worship of the Aten compulsory, to the exclusion of all the other gods. Akhenaten was also re\\n-\\nsponsible for wide-ranging artistic advances. The strange way that Akhenaten himself was depicted – a long, narrow \\nface, very feminine breasts and a big belly – has led some to suspect a medical disorder, but DNA research has revealed \\nnothing of the kind. It is possible that it was simply a stylis\\n-\\ntic quirk; it is certainly very different to the delicate style of Amenhotep III’s time. \\nThe prominent position given to his wife Nefertiti is also an \\ninnovation. In many depictions she is on the same scale as the king and plays an equal part in all kinds of events. It is \\nnot clear whether she was a blood relative of Akhenaten or \\nnot. The couple had a number of daughters. He also fathered at least one son, the future Tutankhamun, although prob\\n-\\nably not by Nefertiti but by one of his other wives, Kiya. Re -\\ncent DNA research has ascertained that Akhenaten was the father of Tutankhamun, and that his mother was related to \\nhis father. One important source of information on this pe\\n-\\nriod is the archive of diplomatic correspondence from Asia \\nMinor, found at Amarna. It comprises clay tablets inscribed \\nin cuneiform, Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the \\ntime. They throw interesting light on the foreign relations of Egypt under Akhenaten. Many of the letters are from \\nEgyptian vassals in Syria-Palestine asking for help against \\nattackers who were apparently aware that there was some\\n-\\nthing strange going on in Egypt.

Another possibility is that Nefertiti and Smenkhkare \\nare one and the same person.\\nThe situation becomes clearer again with the accession of \\nthe next pharaoh, the young Tutankhamun. Akhetaten was abandoned and not reoccupied until Roman times and later, \\nand the royal court returned to Thebes, where Amun was \\nrestored to dominance.

The inex\\n-\\nperience of the young pharaoh nearly led to a major defeat, but eventually the battle ended in a draw.

His residence \\ncity was Sais in the north-west of the Nile Delta. The  \\nAssyrians, who did not have a permanent military presence \\nin Egypt, relied on local rulers like Necho I to look after their \\ninterests. Necho ruled over Memphis, Sais and Athribis, and \\nwas eventually killed in a battle against the Kushite ruler  \\nTanutamani, who conquered the Nile Delta. In the  \\nperiod 663 to 657 BC, the Assyrian king Assurbanipal  \\nregained control of Egypt down as far as Thebes, thus ending  \\nKushite influence in Egypt. After Necho’s death, his son Psamtek I (Psammetikhos I) was installed by Assurbanipal \\nas a local ruler in the Nile Delta. Assurbanipal himself left \\nEgypt to suppress a revolt back in Assyria.During the absence of the Assyrians, Psamtek slowly ex\\n-\\ntended his influence over the whole Nile Delta. In 658 BC, he entered into a coalition with King Gyges of Lydia (Asia \\nMinor, in what is now Turkey). This mutual support pro\\n-\\ntected both rulers from an invasion by the Assyrians, from \\nwhom they both began to become more independent. The \\nrise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the south of Iraq and \\nof the Persian Empire in Iran caused the Assyrians lots of problems, and preventing them from reconquering Egypt \\nor Lydia. Psamtek conducted campaigns against the Libyan \\nrulers in the west, the same rulers who had been able to gain control of the Lower Egyptian throne during the Third Inter\\n-\\nmediate Period. He also used his army of mercenaries along -\\nside diplomacy to compel the rulers of Upper Egyptian cities and provinces to accept his central authority. Psamtek also \\nentered into allegiances with the rulers of Herakleopolis by \\ngiving them positions in his new kingdom. The situation was rather more complicated in Thebes. During the Third Inter\\n-\\nmediate Period, the high priest of Amun had been ousted as the most important religious figure in Thebes by the ‘God’s \\nwife of Amun’. This office goes back to the Middle Kingdom,\\n \\nbut only became influential during the Third Intermedi -\\nate Period. The god’s wife was a woman who ‘married’ the \\ngod Amun and was his representative on earth. She lived in \\ncelibacy in the Temple of Amun and adopted her successor. \\nUnder Kushite rule, the position was filled by members of the Kushite royal family. Psamtek I was able to arrange for \\nhis daughter Nitocris I to be adopted by the Kushite god’s \\nwife Amenirdis II, thus eclipsing the Kushite influence and adding Thebes to his kingdom. At the same time, he was also \\nable to persuade Montuemhat, an influential Amun priest \\nand also governor of Thebes, to support him.Psamtek not only united Egypt, he also changed the admin\\n-\\nistrative organization of the country. The provinces and their administrators were now made subject to the central \\nauthority, achieved by appointing military commanders \\nwho were loyal to Psamtek.

In exchange for these taxes, the Egyp\\n-\\ntians could count on their administration, traditions and \\nreligion remaining relatively untouched under Persian rule. \\nThe only office to be abolished by the Persians was that of \\ngod’s wife of Amun. Cambyses’s actions were rather ambig -\\nuous – on the one hand he significantly slashed the income of most of the temples, and on the other he paid extra at\\n-\\ntention to specific temples such as that of Neith at Sais. The Persian king was regarded as the pharaoh and was depicted \\nas such on temple walls. The Persians started major temple \\nconstruction projects, including the Hibis Temple in Kharga\\n \\nOasis.

This enabled Ptolemy to pay for his wars and also to build a new capital city, Alexandria, which \\ngradually began to take shape. Alexandria was to become \\na Hellenistic cultural centre in the Mediterranean region. Ptolemy initiated the building of the legendary lighthouse \\nand of the Museion, an academic institution of which the \\nfamous library of Alexandria formed part.

That may only have occurred under his son Ptolemy II. As \\nwell as Alexandria, Ptolemy I also founded another city in \\nMiddle Egypt, at present-day Al-Manshah, called Ptolemais Hermiou.

The mummy of Alexander was an important symbol of power, and its possessor could \\ncall on it to legitimate his position as an heir of Alexander. \\nThus Ptolemy gained power over the satrapy of Egypt.

Alexander’s other generals, known as diadochi, governed the provinces of the Near East. They \\ncompeted with each other for power and status. One of the \\nways to do this was to gain control of Alexander’s mummy, which is exactly what Ptolemy had done.

Cult cen\\n-\\ntres for the deified Arsinoe ii sprang \\nup all over egypt, and cities were \\nnamed after her. she was even wor -\\nshipped in the levant. ptolemy iii  \\nappointed priests to maintain the cult \\nof the first deified ptolemies, creating \\na special fifth phyle (group of priests) \\nfor the job. even at the end of the ptolemaic period, Julius Caesar \\n \\ndeified Cleopatra in a certain sense by placing her statue in a temple of \\nVenus in rome. such divine status \\nwas nothing new in egypt – Amenho\\n-\\ntep iii and ramesses ii had been  \\ndeified during their lifetimes – but previously it had been the exception \\nrather than the rule.

The social  \\ndistance between Greeks and egyp -\\ntians, particularly in the early part of the ptolemaic period, is perhaps an \\n \\nindication that the ptolemies never left Alexandria, where Greek pres\\n-\\nence was strongest. on the other hand, we know that Cleopatra and Caesar took a nile cruise through the \\nwhole country.\\nit remains an open question how much the ptolemies interfered in the \\nadministrative processes.

Cornelius Gallus invaded the western Nile Delta. \\nAlexandria was unprotected and after the suicides of Mark \\nAntony and Cleopatra fell into Octavian’s hands. He want -\\ned to spare the city because of its beauty and because it had been founded by Alexander the Great. The Roman historian \\nDio Cassius wrote two centuries later that Octavian visited \\nthe tomb of Alexander, who was his role model. This visit gave him the legitimacy to rule Egypt. During his visit to \\nthe tomb, he apparently took over the powers and rights of \\n \\nAlexander. Octavian thus portrayed himself not as the suc -\\ncessor to the Ptolemies, but as the successor of Alexander, \\nand he even refused to visit the tombs of the Ptolemies  \\nbecause he ‘wanted to see kings, not corpses’.Although Octavian only remained a short time in Egypt, he \\nnevertheless introduced some important changes. Close to \\nAlexandria, where his army was bivouacked, he founded a new city, Nikopolis. This city would remain a garrison \\ntown for a long time, undoubtedly to keep control of the \\nfickle Alexandrian inhabitants. He stationed a further two legions in Egypt – one in Babylon, near Memphis, and the \\nother in Luxor in the south. This was undoubtedly related \\nto the administrative reorganization of Egypt. The coun\\n-\\ntry was divided into three (later four) regions, the epist -\\nrategiae: the Nile Delta, Middle Egypt (including the oases of Bahariya and the Fayum) and the Thebaid (the region \\naround Thebes and southern Egypt, including the oases of \\nKharga and Dakhla). Later the Nile Delta would be divided into an eastern and a western part. The epistrategiae were \\neach governed by an epistrategos, a governor. The differ\\n-\\nent epistrategiae were subdivided into a total of about forty  \\nnomes, roughly matching the pharaonic division of Egypt \\ninto forty-two nomes, each with its own capital. A nome \\nwas administered by a strategos. The administration of the \\nsmaller settlements in a nome was in the hands of local of -\\nficials. De epistrategoi were answerable to the praefectus  \\nAegypti, the prefect appointed by the emperor as the high -\\nest official in Egypt and responsible only to him. All of these Roman officials had relatively short periods in office, prob\\n-\\nably to prevent them building up a power base in Egypt that could be used against the emperor.\\nOctavian, who changed his name to Augustus in 27 BC, had \\nbeen given special powers by the Roman Senate in his fight against Mark Antony. Thanks to these he could claim Egypt \\nas his property, even though he governed the province in \\nthe name of the Roman Senate and the Roman people. The special status of Egypt was underlined by Augustus forbid\\n-\\nding any senator visiting Egypt without his permission. In this way he maintained his grip on his private possessions \\nand prevented the riches and strategic position of Egypt be\\n-\\ning used by a potential rival. A good example of this is the \\nfirst prefect of Egypt, C. Cornelius Gallus, who conducted \\nmilitary campaigns against Meroe, a kingdom to the south \\nof Egypt, and recorded his deeds on stelae in temples.

Egypt was also known as the granary of Rome. \\n \\nBecause taxes were often paid in kind, every year huge ships laden with grain left Alexandria for Rome. Their arrival in \\nRome was a special event, and if they were prevented from \\narriving by storms or unrest in Egypt, it could seal the fate of the emperor. Grain from Egypt enabled the ‘bread and \\ngames’ of the Roman emperors. \\nAlthough Augustus initially portrayed himself modestly as the ‘first citizen’ of the Roman Empire, he was actually the \\nsole ruler: caesar. In Egypt they anticipated this by describ\\n-\\ning Augustus in the Oxyrhynkhos Papyri as ‘Caesar, god, \\nson of god’ with the pharaonic regalia. In that role Augustus  \\ninitiated several construction projects in existing temples and ordered new temples to be built.

Although egypt \\nwas an important province, the resi -\\ndence of the roman emperors was initially in rome and then in Constan\\n-\\ntinople. They were not generally wor -\\nshipped as gods, unlike the ptolem-ies, but did act as the link between \\nhumans and the gods – and were \\nthus demigods. The roman emperor was only depicted as pharaoh on the \\nwalls of the temples, where he wore \\ntraditional costume and performed the traditional roles – offering to the \\ngods and crushing the enemies of \\negypt with a mace. The only major change in the roman period was \\n \\nvisible in the titulary of the depicted emperor. Traditionally, a pharaoh had \\nfive names – his Horus name, his He \\nof the Two ladies name, his Golden Horus name, his throne name and his \\nbirth name. in the roman period, the \\nHe of the Two ladies name and the Golden Horus name were dropped. \\nThe throne name comprised the \\nword ‘caesar’ meaning ‘emperor’ \\n \\nand the birth name the name of the emperor plus the egyptian word for \\n \\nsebastos (augustus): ‘the one who is sacred’. \\nAugustus legitimized his rule in \\negypt by claiming that he had suc\\n-\\nceeded to the throne of Alexander the Great while visiting his tomb in \\nAlexandria. At first, for political rea\\n-\\nsons, Augustus did not want to be \\ndepicted as the demigod pharaoh, \\nbecause the senate would immedi -\\nately have turned against him. in \\nsome temples though, for example \\nthose at Kalabsha and dendera, he \\nwas depicted as pharaoh in his first year, but generally this occurred much later in his reign. The emperors \\nwho followed Augustus frequently \\nused propaganda to legitimize their rule in egypt. For example, they \\nclaimed that they were descended \\nfrom the gods through a divine birth. This was depicted in the mammisis \\nbuilt next to the temples, for exam\\n-\\nple that in dendera, built by nero or \\nTrajan. The building and expanding \\nof temples was one of the ways the \\nroman emperors used to legitimize their rule, as well as a means to keep \\ncontrol of the priesthoods and thus \\nindirectly the local populace.

In \\n630, the followers of Islam, the Muslims, conquered Mecca \\nand then began a quick dissemination of the new religion. The first followers of the prophet brought the Arabian Pen\\n-\\ninsula under the control of a single leader. Caliph Umar con -\\nquered Jerusalem and Damascus, and defeated the Sassanids in the east. Under his leadership, Egypt was wrested from \\nByzantine control in 641. Headed by General ’Amr ibn el-As, \\nan army of four thousand soldiers entered Egypt where they engaged in battle with the Byzantines near Heliopolis. They \\nthen marched to the Roman-Byzantine fort of Babylon, \\nnear the ancient capital Memphis, and on to the Byzantine capital in Egypt, Alexandria. The Egyptians had long been \\nconsidered heretic Christians, since the schism from the \\nByzantine Church in Constantinople, and they had suffered under the taxes imposed by the Byzantines to finance their \\nwars against the Sassanids. This explains why the Egyptians \\noften cooperated with the Muslims, in the hope that they would exploit them less than the Byzantines. As a result, the \\nMuslims did not meet much resistance. Once Byzantine at\\n-\\ntempts to reconquer Egypt had failed, a treaty was signed in \\n641 stating that the Byzantines would leave Egypt. \\nThe Muslims founded a new Egyptian capital just to the \\nnorth of the fort of Babylon, El-Fustat, a city that would later be absorbed by the Cairo of today. The Rashiduns, the \\nfirst four caliphs – called the ‘successors’ after the death of \\nMuhammad in 632 – were followed by fourteen Ummayad caliphs. The last Rashidun caliph – Ali, Mohammad’s cous\\n-\\nin – was murdered, resulting in the birth of the two great ideological movements in Islam, Shi’ite – the followers of \\nAli – and Sunni – the followers of Orthodox Islam. Under \\nthe Rashidun and the Ummayad caliphs, who ruled from Damascus from 661 to 750, Egypt was administered by a \\n \\ngovernor who collected taxes for the caliph. The first gov -\\nernor was ’Amr ibn el-As, who initially took over the Byz -\\nantine administrative system – this system would not be reorganized until the 8th century. He appointed a supreme commander in Egypt, as well as a supreme judge (qadi) and \\na minister of finance. Taxes were levied on agricultural land, \\nand grain was shipped via the Ptolemaic-Roman canal be\\n-\\ntween the Red Sea and the Nile to the Islamic homeland, the Hejaz, the western part of Saudi Arabia, bordering on \\nthe Red Sea. After ’Amr ibn el-As, the Ummayad caliphs \\nappointed governors who alternated between being severe on and well-inclined towards the Egyptian population. In \\nsome periods the Christians and Jews were suppressed. \\nGradually, more and more Muslim migrants from the East settled in Egypt, speeding up the process of Islamization. A \\nnumber of other measures also contributed to this; for ex\\n-\\nample, under the Ummayad caliphs, Coptic was replaced as \\nthe official language of the administration by Arabic, and the \\ncoins were from then on minted in Damascus, the capital of \\nthe Ummayad Empire. In Egypt, many converted to Islam to avoid the increasingly heavy taxes, which Muslims did The southern gate of Bab Zuweila, built in the 11th century, \\ngave access to Fatimid Cairo.

They fought the Mamelukes and eventually \\ndrove them into southern Egypt and the Sudan. Napoleon \\nthen began to restructure Egypt, which turned into a major \\nfiasco. By cooperating with the ulama, the scholars from the Al-Azhar mosque, the most important Islamic religious \\nstudy centre in Cairo, Napoleon hoped to win the popula\\n-\\ntion to his side. Growing dissatisfaction with the French \\npresence, the continually escaping Mameluke leaders ravag -\\ning the south of Egypt and the combined English-Ottoman attacks to repulse the French eventually resulted in the \\nFrench having to leave Egypt after only three years. \\nWhat followed was a struggle between the British, the Ot\\n-\\ntomans and the Mamelukes about who should become governor of Egypt. During this period of chaos, the ulama \\nturned to the only one who appeared to have a vision, Mu\\n-\\nhammed Ali, an Albanian-Ottoman army commander and \\na veteran of the fight against Napoleon. Muhammed Ali \\nbecame pasha of Egypt in name, and thus paid taxes to the \\nOttoman sultan in Istanbul. He consolidated his power in 1811 by killing the last Mameluke leaders, and started to in\\n-\\ndustrialize Egypt as quickly as he could. The country also got its own professional army, consisting of Egyptians for \\nthe first time since the Late Period. Not only the army be\\n-\\ncame Egyptian, the administration and government appara -\\ntus also increasingly became run by Egyptians. Huge textile \\nfactories were set up in Egypt and the Egyptian railway was \\nbuilt. Although not all of these developments were success -\\nful, Muhammed Ali ‘Egyptianized’ the country. His succes -\\nsors – who called themselves ‘sultan’ from 1914 onwards – \\ncontinued his policies. One of these projects was the Suez \\nCanal, which opened in 1869, a modern variant of the canal \\nfrom the Red Sea to the Nile, which made the journey by sea around Africa redundant. \\nHowever, in order to maintain this rate of development, the \\nsuccessors of Muhammed Ali borrowed heavily from Brit\\n-\\nain. As a result, Britain, together with France, became the ac -\\ntual owners of the Suez Canal.

Egypt was \\nseen as a country of fables, as well as the source of all human \\nknowledge and scientific achievements. And the mysterious \\nEgyptian script attracted and fascinated many scholars. The study of Egypt in the Renaissance was mainly through \\ndocuments dating to the Roman Period. In 1505, for exam\\n-\\nple, Hieroglyphica was published, an article in Greek about \\nthe hieroglyphs by the Alexandrian scholar Horapollo, who probably lived in the 4th or 5th century AD. Another im\\n-\\nportant document was found in Macedonia in 1460 – the \\nCorpus Hermeticum. This was a collection of Greek mythi -\\ncal and mystical texts, which according to tradition had been written down by the mythical figure Hermes Trismegistus, \\nalso known as Hermes or the ancient Egyptian god Thoth. \\nThe early scholars also looked at the Egyptian monuments that had been brought to Rome by the Romans, including \\nthe obelisks in the Piazza di Porta San Giovanni and St Pe\\n-\\nter’s Square, the sphinxes in the Iseum Campense, and in \\nPompei at the stelae and shabtis. The two best known schol -\\nars are the priest Piero Valeriano (1477-1558) and the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), mentioned above. Both \\nwrote many articles about the hieroglyphs. Valeriano’s work \\nwas for a long time the standard work for the study of these characters and was a sort of summary of all the knowledge of \\nthem at that time. Kircher believed that the hieroglyphs had \\nsymbolic value and mystical meaning. He studied Coptic, the latest phase of the Egyptian language, and was the first to \\ncorrectly suppose that it was descended from hieroglyphs. \\nHe tried to decipher the hieroglyphs through Coptic, and he considered himself successful, whereas in fact he was \\nnot. Kircher based his work mainly on the Bembine Tablet, \\nor Isiac Tablet, a bronze tablet (probably Roman) with hi\\n-\\neroglyphs which he deciphered, but which are now known to be nonsense. In 1652 Kircher published his famous work \\nOedipus Aegyptiacus, which is one of the very first contri\\n-\\nbutions to the study of ancient Egypt.\\nThe first travellers\\nTravellers from Europe journeyed to Egypt before the Re -\\nnaissance, including doctors and divines.

Students of Champollion set up new degree programmes in Germany, France and Italy. \\nScholars such as Karl Lepsius and Emmanuel De Rougé con\\n-\\ntinued to expand on Champollion’s work and taught at the \\nuniversities of Berlin and Paris, respectively. The academic \\ndiscipline of Egyptology spread across Germany to Jena, \\nLeipzig and Bonn.Until the 1880s, research and teaching continued to concen\\n-\\ntrate on inscribed objects. From that time on, archaeologists together collections of antiquities and sold them to the high -\\nest bidder. Often they were the huge national museums in Europe. Ownership of Egyptian, and particularly Greek and \\nRoman, antiquities was a way for the 19th-century nation \\nstates to underline their descent from these cultures. A good example of this are the Elgin Marbles, part of the Parthe\\n-\\nnon in Athens that the British consul in Istanbul was able to sell to the British Museum.

Pharaonic objects like obelisks and statues, and cults such as those of \\nSerapis and Isis were brought to Rome. After Islam arrived \\nin Egypt, the ancient Egyptian culture mainly interested Is\\n-\\nlamic scholars, alchemists and mystics in search of hidden knowledge. In Europe, the interest was mainly in Coptic \\nhistory as part of the Christian heritage. \\nThe study of Classical Rome during the Renaissance drew attention to the Egyptian elements there. People were fa\\n-\\nmiliar with Egypt, despite few having ever been there. Later on, the obelisk and the sphinx were incorporated into archi\\n-\\ntectural decoration and into objects like clocks. From about 1730, tombs and mausoleums began to display Egyptianiz\\n-\\ning decorative motifs, and so did gardens. The first collec -\\ntors added Egyptian objects to their collections – mummies and inscribed objects such as scarabs and sculptures were \\nparticularly popular. The tales of the travellers and adven\\n-\\nturers who went to Egypt increased this interest. Various \\npaintings and drawings were made with mystical illustra -\\ntions of Egypt, and Egyptianizing elements even found their way into dinner services and architecture. Soon it was no \\nlonger simply a fashion but a generally accepted view that \\nthe Egyptian culture was important. The expedition led by Napeoleon, the publication of the \\nDescription de l’Egypte and the decipherment of the hiero\\n-\\nglyphs triggered the true Egyptomania. Champollion even \\nsigned his Lettre à Mr. Dacier, in which he announced the \\ndecipherment of the script, in hieroglyphs. Tomb monu -\\nments were constructed in the shape of pyramids, Egyptian \\nshapes and motifs were adopted in different contexts due to \\nlove of ostentation as well as pure interest.

Nowadays, the two approaches are intri\\n-\\ncately interwoven.\\nThe archaeological study of Egypt\\nIn the early 19th century, archaeological objects were simp-ly pulled out of the ground by the agents of the consuls, \\nwithout any attention being paid to their situation. By the \\nend of that century, researchers had become aware of the importance of the context of the objects – the environment \\nin which an object is found. For the first time archaeologists \\nbegan to excavate systematically, using excavation trenches and stratigraphic profiles – the different layers in the walls \\nof the excavations trenches – to try to better understand the \\narchaeological sites. One of the most important of these archaeologists was the \\nEnglishman William Matthew Flinders Petrie. He excavated \\nat numerous sites in Egypt, ranging from predynastic sites like Abydos and Naqada, to the settlements of Naukratis and \\nTell Defenna from the Late Period.

This resulted in Egyptian motifs being \\nreused in a series of objects, architectural designs and other elements that were still, however, recognizable as ‘Egyp\\n-\\ntian’.

              " '183tHE nEtHErlands-FlEmisH institutE in Cairo\\nthe netherlands-Flemish \\ninstitute in Cairo\\nThe Netherlands-Flemish Institute in Cairo (NVIC) was \\nfounded in 1971. It was originally called the Netherlands \\nInstitute for Archaeology and Arabic Studies and only rep -\\nresented Dutch universities. Currently eight Dutch and \\nFlemish universities participate in the NVIC, with the aim \\nof stimulating and propagating their teaching and research \\nactivities in the Middle East. \\nThe Netherlands-Flemish Institute in Cairo is an academic \\ncentre that provides services to staff and students of the participating universities. These activities primarily relate \\nto Arabic and Islamic Studies, Egyptology, Archaeology and \\nPapyrology, although the NVIC also facilitates the univer\\n-\\nsities in other disciplines and represents them in a general sense. \\nBoth the staff of the institute and the research fellows con\\n-\\nduct their work on behalf of the participating universities. \\nThe NVIC regularly organizes symposia in the fields related \\nto its expertise, and it also organizes courses in the archae -\\nology of Egypt and Arabic Studies at academic level as an \\nintegral part of the BA and MA degree programmes of the \\nDutch and Flemish universities. These courses concentrate on practical knowledge and academic experience in Egypt, \\nand thus contribute significantly to both fields at the partici -\\npating universities. In addition, the NVIC supervises theses, papers and other individual study programmes for students \\nduring their stay in Egypt. The NVIC also organizes special \\ncourses on request in the fields of the languages and cul\\n-\\ntures of Egypt and the Middle East for non-university target groups (government institutions, businesses).\\nFinally, the Institute contributes to the dissemination of \\nDutch and Flemish culture and the promotion of Dutch/\\nFlemish-Egyptian cooperation, in close cooperation with \\nthe relevant institutes in the Netherlands and Flanders and the respective embassies in Cairo, primarily by offering \\nDutch language courses.\\nThe NVIC is supported by the following institutes:\\nIn the Netherlands:\\nThe Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, University \\nof Leiden (administrating institution), University of Amster -\\ndam, VU University Amsterdam, University of Groning  en, \\nRadboud University Nijmegen, Utrecht University\\nIn Flanders:\\nThe Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO), the KU Leuven \\nand Ghent University. \\nDr Rudolf de JongThe netherlands-Flemish institute in Cairo.',\n",

              " '11\\nEternal Egypt unfurls the fascinating history of Egypt and \\ngoes deeper than the pharaoh and mummy stereotypes.  \\nIt focuses on the long history of Egypt, from earliest prehis -\\ntory (1,600,000 BC) down to modern Coptic and Islamic times. We offer readers an overview of the rich Egyptian \\ncollection in the Allard Pierson Museum, of archaeological \\nfieldwork being conducted in Egypt by Dutch and Flemish universities, and of ancient Egyptian culture.\\nThe archaeological collection in the Museum illustrates the \\ninspiring and multifaceted history of Egypt from prehistory up to and including the early Middle Ages. Archaeological fieldwork in Egypt has resulted in surprising new perspec\\n-\\ntives for many years. Last but not least, this publication also highlights the excavations conducted by the Allard Pierson \\nMuseum for over twenty years at Tell Ibrahim Awad under \\nthe supervision of curator Willem van Haarlem.When you think of Egypt, prehistoric petroglyphs, the \\nGreek Ptolemaic Dynasty, Roman temples or Coptic \\n \\nmonasteries are not what first springs to mind. However, that \\nwill certainly change after reading this publication and visit -\\ning the accompanying exhibition. Much of the credit is due to the Netherlands-Flemish Insititute in Cairo (NVIC). The \\n \\ninnovative research that has been facilitated for years by this institute has been a fantastic and irreplaceable stimulus. \\nThe cooperation between the Allard Pierson Museum and \\nthe Netherlands-Flemish Institute has been crucial, and is \\n \\nillustrated by this publication and exhibition. We would like to express our particular thanks to director Dr Rudolph \\nde Jong and assistant director Dr Andre Veldmeijer for their \\nsupport and assistance.The publication of Eternal Egypt and the accompanying \\n \\nexhibition Eternal Egypt Experience are also the result \\nof close cooperation with the Bibliotheca Alexandrina/\\nCultnat, with the assistance of Deputy Director Mohamed \\nFarouk being of particular importance.The exhibition was compiled by Willem van Harlem, who \\ntogether with Ben van den Bercken is also responsible for \\nthe accompanying publication. This project presents the most recent insights concerning Egypt, and has gratefully made use of the research results of the excavations in Egypt conducted under the auspices of the NVIC. We would like \\nto warmly thank Dr Dirk Huyge (Qurta and El-Kab), Wil\\n-\\nlem van Haarlem (Tell Ibrahim Awad) , Prof. Harco Willems \\n(Deir el-Bersheh), Prof. Maarten Raven (Saqqara), Prof. Olaf \\nKaper (Dakhla/Kellis), Marie-Cécile Bruwier and Francis \\nChoël (Smouha) and Dr Karel Innemée (Deir el-Baramus), who have allowed visitors to this exhibition and readers of \\nthis publication to peek over their shoulders and share in \\nthe historical sensation of working in Egypt. Eternal Egypt is the third part of what has become \\n \\na distinct and successful series for the general public by the Allard Pierson Museum, and is published in coopera\\n-\\ntion with WBOOKS of Zwolle. The coordination of the publication was organized by Paulien Retèl and the editor \\nwas Toon Vugts. The translation into English was by Julia \\n \\nHarvey. The project coordinator for the exhibition was  \\nMarian Schilder, the design of the publication was in the \\nhands of Miriam Schlick (Extrablond) and of the exhibition \\nin those of Conita Vermeulen (m3 bouwkunst). The steer -\\ning group was chaired by Steph Scholten, director of UvA \\nErfgoed. We would like to thank all of them for their contri -\\nbution to the realization of the publication and exhibition. This project was made possible with the generous support \\nof DJOSER Reizen and the Friends of the Allard Pierson \\nMuseum. The Friends assist the Museum to expand and \\n \\nrealize its ambitions, and this exhibition and publication are the tangible results of this cooperation.\\nEgypt has inspired us, and hopefully it will also inspire you. \\nEternal Egypt demonstrates that the important cultural \\n \\nheritage of Egypt is irrevocably intertwined with European cultural history. \\nDr Wim Hupperetz\\nDirector of the Allard Pierson MuseumForeword ',\n",

              " '17prEHistoriC EgyptThe first hominids entered Egypt about 300,000 years \\nago. They settled along the fertile banks of the river Nile.  \\nBetween 56 and 35 million years ago there was a ‘Proto-Nile’ that flowed through the Western Desert and formed \\nthe basis for the present-day Nile. The Proto-Nile and the \\nNile have gradually shifted towards the east. As a result, any traces left by habitation by the earliest humans on the east \\nbank have most likely been obliterated.\\nThe Nile probably acquired its current form at the start of the Pliocene Era (5.5 to 2.5 million years ago). The river is \\nfed by smaller rivers – the Atbara, the White Nile (linking it \\n \\nto Lake Victoria) and the Blue Nile (linking it to Lake Tana) – \\nand inundated regularly due to meltwaters from the moun -\\ntain ranges of Central Africa. This periodic inundation re -\\nsulted in the deposition of fertile silt, but the Nile could also wash earth out of the valley. The river eroded a passage into \\nthe landscape, creating higher areas or terraces. These play \\nan important role in the archaeological hunt for the first in\\n-\\nhabitants of the Nile Valley. Just past Cairo, the Nile divides into a number of branches that debouch into the Mediterra\\n-\\nnean Sea, creating the Nile Delta. This is a fertile region that changed regularly as a result of the drying up and shifting of \\nthe river branches, as well as through the creation of new \\nbranches. Just as today, there were oases in Pharaonic Egypt. The best \\nknown is the Fayum Oasis. This low-lying region in the \\n \\ndesert is delimited on its north side by a steep cliff and \\ngradu ally rises towards the south. The Fayum is fed by a \\nbranch of the Nile that splits off at about the level of current-day El Ashmunein. This oasis was an important agricultural area, particularly during the Middle Kingdom and the Grae\\n-\\nco-Roman periods. A number of oases are located in the Western Desert, parallel to the Nile – Siwa, Bahariya, Fara\\n-\\nfra, Dakhla, Kharga and Selima. These oases, too, are often  \\ndelimited on their north side by a steep cliff and gradu -\\nally rise towards the south. However, unlike the Fayum, they are not fed by river water but by artesian wells – places \\nwhere the groundwater is pushed up through the surface.\\nLower Palaeolithic (1,600,000\\xad248,000 BC) \\nThere were people in the Nile Valley in the Early Palaeo -\\nlithic Period. This is proved by the discovery of flint tools \\ndating to about 298,000 BC. This period is characterized \\nby the production and use of bifacial tools – flint tools \\nworked on two sides. They can probably be attributed to the hominid Homo erectus, the first humans who walked fully \\n \\nupright. The theory is that Homo erectus trekked through the region as a hunter-gatherer. The tools that have been in the middle palaeolithic, flint blades were manufactured  \\non a major scale using the levallois technique – a develop-\\nment of a technique used in a slightly different way already \\nin the early palaeolithic. several blades could be struck from \\nlarge flint cores. Just like a swiss army knife, they could be \\nused for anything and everything, and sometimes even  \\nreworked into a different tool. These blades have a triangular \\nprofile and a flat back. Height: 7 and 9.67 cm.\\nmicroliths (lit. small stones) are first found in egypt in the \\nlate palaeolithic. These small, sharp flints were often made \\nby splitting up larger flint blades. They could then be worked \\nas required to make even sharper edges. microliths could be \\nused as arrowheads, or as part of a larger tool, for example by setting them into a wooden shaft. These examples were \\nfound at late palaeolithic/early neolithic temporary sites in \\nthe Fayum oasis. Heights between 2.2 and 3.4 cm.',\n",

This is because either this material \\nwas not preserved, or the original archaeological sites were \\nwashed away or covered by the Nile.It is difficult to say how many of these early Palaeolithic \\nsites there are, or how they are distributed through the \\nlandscape. In Egypt we know of sites near Luxor and close to Nag Ahmed el-Khalifa (c. 298,000 BC). Similar finds have \\nbeen made in Sudan at a few higher-lying rock formations. \\nAt site Arkin-8 in North Sudan, tools made from local flint have been found, as well as sandstone blocks that are placed \\nin such a way that they might have formed part of a building. \\nIn the Wadi Halfa region, researchers were able to differen\\n-\\ntiate between flint tools from several periods. This was also where the oldest known tools with traces of what is known \\nas the Levallois technique have been found. This is a special \\nknapping technique for flint that only later became fully de\\n-\\nveloped. The technique involves a flint core being prepared along its edges, resulting in a shape reminiscent of a tortoise \\nshell. A large flake can then be struck from this tortoise core. \\nThis flake is immediately usable as a tool, for example a knife. In the Western Desert, tools have been found in Dakhla and \\nKharga oases (c. 298,000-248,000 BC) and near old, dried-\\nout wells. The hominids who used these tools lived in a cli\\n-\\nmate that was much moister and where the oases and wells were numerous. \\nMiddle Palaeolithic (248,000\\xad38,000 BC)\\nIn the early Middle Palaeolithic period, it became more arid in Egypt. Wells in the Western Desert dried up and the Nile \\nbegan to flow more slowly. The groups of hunter-gatherers \\nwere forced to move closer to water sources such as the Nile   This rectangular stone chisel was found in the Fayum \\noasis. it is made of a large flint flake and is worked on \\nall sides. such tools are regularly found with axes, dou-\\nble-edged knives, arrowheads and pottery in the West-\\nern desert.

During the Middle Pal -\\naeolithic there were also wetter periods when the groups \\ncould move to the temporary oases. At about this time the \\nhominids were using bifacial tools, and often tools made us -\\ning the Levallois technique. Most of the sites we know about \\nare in the Western Desert. This is where the groups of peo -\\nple gathered different kinds of plants and hunted animals, from hare and wildcat to gazelle and giraffe. There are also \\ncaves with traces of hearths found on the Red Sea coast near \\nthe Eastern Desert, so groups of hominids must have lived in this area too. In the Nile Valley, however, we only have \\ntraces of flint quarrying on the Nile terraces from this pe\\n-\\nriod. The sites that were occupied were probably closer to \\nthe river and are now covered by thick layers of Nile silt.\\nIn around 98,000 BC the climate again became drier, and \\nagain the people were forced into the Nile Valley. In the subsequent Taramsa Hill phase (88,000-33,000 BC), peo\\n-\\nple made flint flakes using the Levallois technique on a large scale. This technique enabled them to get several long flakes \\nfrom a single core, each with a clear point and a triangular \\nprofile. This phase has also produced the oldest known \\n \\nburial of an anatomically ‘modern human’ (c. 53,000 BC), found near Taramsa Hill. Shafts dug by hunter-gatherers to \\nquarry flint for their tools have also been found there. In Su\\n-\\ndan, near the site Khor Musa, tools have been found associ -\\nated with charcoal and the bones of aurochs, gazelle, fowl \\nand fish. Further to the north, human remains have also \\nbeen found in the Wadi Kubbaniya. \\nIt is difficult to draw up a chronology for the Mid-Palaeolith -\\nic based on the different types of tools. The finds that have been made mainly prove that flint was mined. Several dif\\n-\\nferent assemblages (large quantities together) of flint tools ',\n",

The first traces of humans found \\n \\nthus far date to the end of the early palaeolithic period and come from \\nthe nile Valley. This could be proof \\nthat hominids in this period had to \\nstay close to the edges of the water \\n(nile and oases) to survive. At any rate, they continued to apply this \\nstrategy in the following millennia. \\nduring the middle palaeolithic, the upper palaeolithic and the late \\n \\npalaeolithic periods, the shifting of the southern monsoon border and \\nthe northern mediterranean border \\nresulted in periods of arid and wet \\nclimates alternating with each other. \\neven during these periods there could be significant shifts in tempe-\\nrature. The climate changes in the \\nsouth affected the flow of the nile, but rain brought to the Western \\n variety of animals and plants. long ago in egypt and sudan, elephants, \\ngiraffes and ostriches used to wander \\naround. With the passage of time, however, these animals began to \\n \\nappear only much further to the south. Humans, animals and plants \\nadapted to the climate and a fragile \\nbalance was achieved with the \\n \\nimmediate environment. After the last wet period in about 6,000-5,000 \\nBC, the climate became drier and \\nhas remained arid down to the \\n \\npresent day. in the meantime,  \\nthe groups of people learned to  \\nmanipulate their environment by  \\ndomesticating animals and plants,  \\nso that despite the aridity they  \\ncould live perma nently in the  \\nnile Valley.desert changed it into a steppe  \\nregion. As the water levels in the nile rose \\ndue to the monsoon rains in the \\nsouth, the inundation plain was no longer always inhabitable, and the \\npeople shifted their settlements to \\nthe edges of the nile Valley. Wadis, seasonal waterways that became \\n \\npermanently dry later on, contained a lot of water during the wet periods, \\n \\nthus creating large expanses of green, habitable areas, for example \\nthe Wadi Kubbaniya and the Wadi \\nHalfa. The groundwater levels in many areas must also have been \\nmuch higher, with artesian wells and \\nalso playas (seasonal lakes) offering groups of humans a means of survival.\\nClimate change also influenced the ClimatE and ClimatE CHangE\\nduring the arid periods in egyptian prehistory, the savannah-like Western desert  \\nbecame a dry sandy expanse, as seen here at saqqara. survival was virtually impossi-\\nble.

During \\nthe Late Palaeolithic, different groups of people (cultures) \\ncan be differentiated on the basis of the flint tool assem -\\nblages. In the period 19,000-13,000 BC, they mainly com -\\nprised small blades and microliths – small flint tools only a few centimeters long. Microliths could be made by splitting \\nlong blades up into smaller parts, but they could also be sim\\n-\\nple small flakes. This technique enabled optimum use to be \\nmade of the flint – every flake was used.\\nIn the dry river beds, called wadis, water remained stand -\\ning in temporary lakes. They were often a rich source of \\nflora and fauna, which encouraged people to remain in their  \\nvicinity. In the Wadi Kubbaniya and at the site Makhad -\\nma-4, for example, fish were caught on a large scale. The fish were trapped in small pools and lakes in the wadi after the \\ninundation receded. At the sites Makhadma-2 and Makhad\\n-\\nma-4 (c. 10,450-10,050 BC), the fish were not only caught \\non a large scale but also preserved by being smoked. It thus \\nappears that people were laying in food reserves for the  \\nperiods when there was less food available. In addition to fish \\nbones, the bones of aurochs, hartebeest (a kind of antelope) \\nand gazelle have been found there. In the Wadi Kubbaniya, \\nthe oldest known millstones have been found in large num -\\nbers. The inhabitants of the Nile Valley thus adapted to their changed environment. The creation of food reserves reveals \\nthat from about 10,000 BC there must have been changes \\nin the way food was shared among the group and thus also in the mutual social relationships. This was the first step on \\nthe way to a more permanent, sedentary way of life and an \\nincrease in the population in the Nile Valley.At the end of the Late Palaeolithic, the climate again became \\nwetter and floods occurred. From this period, known as the \\n‘wild Nile’ stage (11,000-10,000 BC), and that immediately following (10,000-6,000 BC), graves have been found that \\nreveal that the dead were buried in line with certain cus\\n-\\ntoms. For example, at Gebel Sahaba (c. 10,000 BC) the dead \\nwere buried on their left sides in a flexed position and fac -\\ning south. The burial pits were then covered with sandstone slabs. Some of the people buried here seem to have died a \\nnatural death, but many of the others appear to have been \\ndeliberately killed. This is indicated by finds of bones with flint points embedded in them and with cut marks. It is pos\\n-\\nsible that these people were killed in conflict with another group. During the ‘wild Nile’ stage, people lived closer to \\neach other because the Nile Valley was mainly under water.\\nIn general, it is assumed that the Nile Valley was sparsely populated in the period 10,000-6,000 BC. We also know have been found dating to the Middle Palaeolithic. This could mean that at that time there were different groups of people or cultures in the Nile Valley. \\nUpper Palaeolithic (38,000\\xad22,000 BC)\\nThe extreme aridity during the Upper Palaeolithic forced the groups of humans to stay close to water sources such \\nas the Nile and the Oases. This period is the first in which \\nHomo sapiens sapiens turns up in Egypt. The flint technolo\\n-\\ngies from the late Middle Palaeolithic were continued, but flint was being worked more and more efficiently. There \\nis now little waste product, and a high quality level was \\nreached when working it.In Nazlet Khater-4 in Middle Egypt, two graves have been \\nfound with Homo Sapiens. They contain the oldest known \\nburial goods in Egypt – in one grave was a bifacial axe and in the other a human foetus and ostrich eggs. These graves \\nlie close to a place where flint was mined. The people dug \\nholes and underground tunnels to get to the deeper-lying flint. This is an example of one of the earliest known under\\n-\\nground mining techniques in the world.There are few sites known in Egypt dating to the Upper \\n \\nPalaeolithic. Cultures such as the Shuwikhatian and Hal -\\nfan cultures are representative of this period. Longer blades were created using the Levallois technique. \\nLate Palaeolithic (19,000 – c. 6,000 BC)\\nMany Late Palaeolithic sites have been found in the south -\\nern Nile valley. During this period the climate remained very arid. As a result, the Nile retracted in its bed and \\n Birket Qarun, the lake in the Fayum oasis, had different  \\nwater levels through time.

One ex -\\nplanation is that there were so many natural food sources in the Nile Valley that there was no need or pressure to adapt \\nthe old fishing, hunting, gathering way of life. This process \\nonly began with the arid phase at the start of the Middle \\n \\nNeolithic period. The inhabitants of the Western Desert were then once more forced into the Nile Valley.\\nThere are many traces of habitation in the Western Desert \\nfrom the period 6,500-4,700 BC. There were two types of habitation site – settlement sites and what are called task \\nsites, places where people went for short periods, for exam\\n-\\nple to excavate flints, catch fish or track herds of wild animals. \\nAt the settlement sites, traces have been found of buildings \\nthat were reinforced with stone, as well as the remains of \\nbuildings made of mud and wood. During the Early Neo -\\nlithic period, blades were slowly replaced by simple flakes that during this wetter period, people once again occupied the oases of the Western Desert. This is also the period \\nwhen the first rock art appears on high ground such as Abka \\nin Sudan, and in Egypt in the Wadi Abu Subeira and in El Hosh and Qurta. The carved and scratched petroglyphs \\nshow images of cattle, humans and fishtraps. \\nNeolithic period (8,800\\xad4,700 BC) \\nThe wetter period continued on into the Neolithic period, \\nresulting in the Western Desert developing a permanent \\npopulation. Just like the people in the Nile Valley in later \\nperiods, they first tended herds of domesticated animals and used pottery. These are two of the most important charac\\n-\\nteristics of Neolithic cultures.The periodic rains and inundations forced the groups to \\nmove around, whereby they populated the oases of the \\nWestern Desert during the inundation season. Nabta Playa and Bir Kiseiba are the best known sites from the early Neo\\n-\\nlithic period (8,800-6,800 BC). At Bir Kiseiba, asemblages of flint have been found that include microliths. The inhab\\n-\\nitants kept cattle, but also hunted hare and gazelle. The old -\\nest known pottery also dates from this period. They are sim -\\nple forms, mainly dishes, decorated with dotted lines and  \\npatterns that appear to have been scratched into the clay with a comb. The remains of simple huts and storage pits, \\npossibly for food, have been found near Nabta Playa, and \\nmust have been located on the banks of a lake.Although the Neolithic period had begun in the Western \\nDesert, the people living in the Nile Valley were still follow\\n-\\ning a Late Palaeolithic lifestyle. These groups of people con -\\ntinued to hunt, fish and gather. Two sites are known in the \\nNile Valley from this period. At the first, El-Kab in Middle \\nEgypt, the people lived on the banks of the Nile. They fished \\nin pools left after the inundation season, but also in the Nile itself, which indicates that they must have had boats. They \\nhunted animals that lived in the nearby wadi regions, for \\nexample gazelle and Barbary sheep. Just as in the Western Desert, microliths were used for hunting and fishing. In the \\nEastern Desert, on the other side of the Nile, traces have \\nbeen found that are comparable to those at El-Kab, which might indicate that these people too were nomadic hunters \\ntied to the seasons. However, the oldest traces of domesti\\n-\\ncated sheep and goats come from this region (c. 6,000-5,500 \\nBC). They were found near Quseir, where the settlements \\nhave been labelled Neolithic for this reason. The second \\nsite in the Nile Valley where the Late Palaeolithic way of life continued was the Fayum Oasis (from about 8,100 BC). \\nHere, too, fish were an important part of the diet, and hunt\\n-red polished squat jars such as this one mainly come from \\nburial contexts.

A few sites between Matmar and Hemamia com -\\nprise settlements and cemeteries that together form the \\nheart of the area covered by this culture. The sites can cer -\\ntainly be dated to the period 4,400-4,000 BC, but may be even older. The Badarian culture found here is a mixture of \\nweak influences from the Nile Valley and strong influences \\nfrom the Western Desert. The graves at these sites reveal that there were people of varying status living here – some were \\ngiven more burial goods than others. The pottery found \\nin the graves is very similar to that of the later Predynastic Naqada culture – small bowls and cups of a brownish colour, \\nwith a rippled surface and sometimes a black, polished rim. \\nThis pottery was used to store grain, among other things. Just as at Merimde Beni-Salame, there were simple houses \\nof wattle and daub. Animal shelters have been found, too, \\nidentified by the animal excrement. Various objects have been found in the settlements – bifacial flint tools, copper \\nbeads, hairpins and combs made of bone, bracelets, cosmetic \\npalettes and female figurines made of ivory and bone.The remains of the Badarian culture have not just been \\nfound in that region. Further to the south, in Hierakonpolis, \\nDendara, Armant and the Wadi Hammamat, similar mate\\n-\\nrial has also been found. In the Eastern Desert, too, and in the coastal regions of the Red Sea, traces of the Badarian \\nculture have been found. In turn, shells that were trans\\n-\\nported via the Eastern Desert have been found in graves in \\nthe Nile Valley. It is thus certain that there must have been \\ncontact between these regions.

From about 4,900 BC, this was gradually replaced by polished red \\npottery, for example at Nabta Playa, Bir Kiseiba and in the \\nDakhla Oasis. In Nabta Playa, in the period 5,100-4,700 BC, the first public architecture was constructed. Huge rocks \\nwere assembled around the burial of a bull. Close by, smaller \\nstones were set up, perhaps to be used as a star chart. People would have to have worked together to achieve these pro\\n-\\njects, which is an indication that social relationships were becoming more complex. After about 4,400 BC, the West\\n-\\nern Desert developed the climate that we know today.In the Nile Valley, a lot changed in around 5,100 BC. In the \\nFayum Oasis, the Fayumian culture developed (5,450-4,400 \\nBC). This resembled the cultures from the Western Desert much more than those from the Nile Valley. It is possible \\nthat groups of people from the desiccating Western Desert \\nhad moved to the Fayum Oasis. Sites in that region have \\n \\nrevealed subterranean grain silos and traces of domesticated plants, including wheat and flax. These domesticated plants \\nwere possibly introduced via the Nile Delta from the Near \\nEast. The arrival of the people from the Western Desert meant that there were food shortages. This was resolved \\nfrom 6,200 BC on by the large-scale cultivation of plants. \\nAlongside agriculture, animal husbandry and fishing were the most important food sources. We also see the first do\\n-\\nmesticated sheep and goats in the Fayum Oasis. There was also trade – sites from the Late Neolithic period regularly \\ncontain objects that were probably acquired through con\\n-\\ntact with regions further away, for example shells and stone \\npalettes used to apply cosmetics. \\nMerimde Beni-Salame is an important site from the Late \\nNeolithic period. The bones of domesticated sheep, cattle, pigs and goats have been found here in the oldest archaeo\\n-\\nlogical layers (c. 4,800 BC). Pottery has been found in the more recent layers of the site, as well as figurines of bone \\nand ivory. This site has also revealed a short street of oval \\nhouses made of wattle and daub. Each house had its own storage silo, hearth, millstone and waterpot. The sites of the \\nEl Omari culture (named after the discoverer and dated to \\n4,600-4,350 BC) reveal a similar material culture. In the re\\n-\\ngion around Luxor and in Sudan, pottery now appears for the first time. Changed lifestyles, influences from outside \\nEgypt, and even another way of looking at the environment \\nall reveal that the groups of people were becoming more complex.

This has been the way for thousands of years.The Pre\\xad\\ndynastic and Early Dynastic Periods\\nthe predynastic period\\nIn the winter of 1894-1895, the distinguished British  \\narchaeologist William Matthew Flinders Petrie made a puz -\\nzling discovery in Naqada, in Upper Egypt. He found a large \\narea full of graves whose contents were completely differ -\\nent to anything excavated before in Egypt – vases decorated with all kinds of figures, red pottery with their upper halves \\nblack, cosmetic palettes and mace heads. This was so dif\\n-\\nferent to what had been found thus far that Petrie initially \\njumped to the conclusion that they must have been the \\ngraves of immigrants and not of indigenous Egyptians. It \\nsoon turned out that there was a much simpler explanation – they were the material remains of the earliest Egyptians \\nknown up till then. When he later discovered more such \\ngraves not far away, he had enough material to try to place it into the right chronological order. To do so, he developed a \\nbrilliant statistical system which he called Sequence Dating. \\nAs he expected that a different method or more data would give his finds absolute dates, he used the method as a rela\\n-\\ntive dating system.Petrie’s system mainly depended on the development \\n \\nundergone by certain pottery shapes. For example, he saw  \\na development over time in the changes to pottery with wavy handles – first they had functional handles, later on only a \\ndecorative wavy line in shallow relief. The system remained \\nin use for a long time, until better dating methods were \\n \\ndeveloped. One of these is C14 dating, which measures the decay over time of an instable form of carbon, thus enabling \\nan absolute date to be established for organic material.When exactly did the Predynastic Period start in Egypt, and \\nwhen did prehistory stop? The answer to this question is still being vigorously discussed, and is thus arbitrary up to \\na certain point. This book will follow the most commonly \\naccepted terminology and chronology. This means that we view the Predynastic Period as starting in 4000 BC with \\nwhat is called Naqada I, after the site where the material was \\ndiscovered.\\nNaqada I (4000\\xad3500 BC)\\nThe increasingly arid climate, a process that started in the prehistoric period, forced the population more and more \\ninto the Nile Valley. The agriculture that had emerged in the \\npreceding Neolithic period was now the definitive means of existence, and the many separate cultures that started before \\nthat time now slowly began to evolve into a more coherent \\nwhole. The combination of increased population density in the Nile Valley and the slow drying out of the surrounding \\nareas resulted in increasing isolation – a precondition for the \\ndevelopment of an independent and social culture relatively undisturbed by outside influences. One drawback for this \\nperiod is that much more archaeological research has been \\nconducted in cemeteries than in settlement sites. This is be\\n-\\ncause people preferred to bury their dead in locations at the edge of the desert so that they did not have to use valuable ',\n",
              " '30\\neternal egypt\\nfertile land. As a result, such cemeteries are easy to localize \\nand to investigate. Settlements, on the other hand, were in \\nthe fertile valley and were regularly replaced by later settle -\\nments, making them much harder to access. They also left \\nfar fewer remains, as the constructions in which they lived \\nwere mainly made of wood and reeds, material that leaves \\nfar fewer traces than stone or mudbrick. One of the few properly investigated sites is located at Hierakonpolis, far \\nto the south. During this period and the one following it, \\n \\nHierakonpolis developed into an important economic and \\nadministrative centre. The houses were varied, with not \\nonly reeds, palm tree trunks and wood being used, but also \\nmud, not yet in the form of separate bricks, but applied lay -er by layer in a way that you still encounter in Egypt. The fences for domesticated animals were also constructed in \\nthis way. This may be due to the equally varied socioeco\\n-\\nnomic circumstances. Part of the population was still semi-  \\nnomadic, with the herders of flocks of sheep, goats and  \\ncattle visiting the available meadows in tune with the  \\nseasons – a bit like the Bedouin of the Nile Delta still do  \\ntoday. Another part was more settled, and cultivated barley, \\nwheat, flax and fruits. Hunting for gazelle, ostrich and hip -\\npopotamus remained an important food source, as did fish -\\ning. The desertification was not yet complete, so there were still many different types of animals that can now only be \\nfound in the plains of East Africa. Much less material from \\nNaqada I and II has been found in the Nile Delta than in the Nile Valley, but nevertheless it is possible to see differences. \\nThe excavated settlement site of Merimde Beni Salame in \\nthe Western Delta is the main source of this information. Here, the graves of the dead were found between the hous\\n-\\nes, not in a separate cemetery. This appears to be relatively common in the Delta, even in later times.\\nMany different types of graves may indicate social strata and \\nperhaps even religious tendencies. A small number of graves were rich in burial goods, while the majority were signifi\\n-\\ncantly less well provisioned. What is particularly noticeable is the role of mace heads, whose wooden handles have often \\nrotted away. In some of the richer burials, these functioned \\nas symbols of the power of the deceased. Mace heads would play this role for a very long time to come. Apparently a sort \\nof leader class began to develop, as yet with only limited \\npower. New elements such as population increase and con\\n-\\ncentration, and permanent settlements instead of the usual moving around, worked in favour of this trend. The discov\\n-\\nery of a model of a defensive wall with sentry posts suggests that this process was not conflict-free – even more reason \\nto form population concentrations under secure conditions, \\nfor example villages with ramparts.\\nNaqada II (3500\\xad3200 BC)\\nThis phase began in around 3500 BC. Unlike the preced -\\ning period, remains from Naqada II have been found over a much wider area, including the Eastern Delta and Nubia. \\nThere also appears to have been more contact between the \\ndifferent parts of the country, and even with abroad. Proper urban centres arose at Naqada and Hierakonpolis, unlike the \\nsmaller settlements of Naqada I. The settlements were also \\ncloser to the Nile, probably as a result of the further aridifi\\n-\\ncation of the surrounding areas. The increased numbers are also an indication of population growth.

Towards the end of this period, the first three of \\nthese power centres formed what would later develop into \\na sort of Upper Egyptian proto-kingdom. When this state gradually began to expand to the south and the north, unifi\\n-\\ncation of the country became a realistic option.Hunting now plays a lesser role in food provision, which was becoming more and more efficient. The first indications \\nof small-scale irrigation played a part in this. One impor\\n-\\ntant consequence was the significant increase in handmade \\nproducts, both in numbers and in variety. This means that \\npart of the population was no longer involved in contribut -\\ning to food production and was able to concentrate on be -\\ncoming expert at making these products.

This additionally means that a central redis -\\ntribution of food products was needed to regulate this – tax -\\nation in kind by an accepted authority. This administrative elite was buried in large graves, richly provided with these \\nluxury products. For the first time we encounter imported \\nitems as well, for example of ivory, ebony and gold.

For the time being the \\npharaohs continued to be buried in the traditional necropo -\\nlis at Abydos, while at the same time cenotaphs were built for them in the new necropolis of Saqqara, on the desert \\nplateau opposite Memphis, as symbols of the single entity \\nthat Egypt was from that time on.

That their original roles \\nwere fetish and totem animals is the most plausible explanation. Traces \\n \\nof them can still be seen in the em -\\nblems of the individual nomes, which remained in use throughout the en\\n-\\ntire history of ancient egypt. most  \\nof the many gods we know from  \\nancient egypt are local, as a result  \\nof the geographical divisions of the country. during naqada i it appears \\nthat the bull and the cow played a \\nmajor role, judging by the iconogra\\n-\\nphy on vases and in sculpture. From that moment on, the dead were no \\nlonger buried in a stellar orientation, \\nbut aligned with the nile. This could have a religious meaning – there are \\nindications of a star cult, and we \\nmeet clear traces of this in the later pyramid Texts. \\nAs a result of the political union, \\n \\nwe first see what could be termed \\ncross-border national gods emerg -\\ning. The victors brought their own gods with them, such as the falcon \\ngod Horus of triumphant Hierakon\\n-\\npolis, but not necessarily at the cost \\nof local gods. Gods with human \\nforms are still scarce, but later on  \\nthe animal gods could also take on  \\na human or partially human shape. \\nThis centralizing tendency is not yet \\ndiscernible in local temple construc -\\ntion. in the few early temples of \\nwhich we know anything about, for \\nexample at elephantine, Hierakon-\\npolis, Abydos and Tell ibrahim Awad, the local cults appear to have the \\n Amulet of Horus, green faience.

Djer’s tomb complex reveals striking changes and innovations when compared \\nto the constructions of his predecessors. The tomb itself is \\nrectangular, with a thick outer wall and niches. It is not pos\\n-\\nsible to reconstruct what it originally looked like, because the tomb was later regarded as the tomb of Osiris and rebuilt \\nwith that idea in mind.

Djoser is mainly renowned for his famous Step Pyra -\\nmid complex at Saqqara, which replaced Abydos as the royal necropolis from that time on. In the complex, architectural \\ndevelopments from the previous period are brought togeth\\n-\\ner to form a new kind of burial monument.\\nThe Step Pyramid itself started off as a single mastaba tomb, \\nbut was extended in a series of stages with ever-smaller \\nmastabas on top of it, finally forming five ‘steps’. The royal tomb is beneath this monument. The remains of a mortuary \\ntemple can be seen on the north side. The pyramid forms \\nthe centrepiece of a huge rectangular complex, surrounded by an enclosure wall. All kinds of elements from the palace \\nof the living king can be found here, in durable limestone in\\n-\\nstead of mudbrick, wood and reeds – after all, the tomb was \\nsupposed to last for ever. In addition, it was to be a symbol \\nof the unity of the country, which is why elements of both \\nnorthern and southern palace architecture were included. There was also a separate area for the ritual run of the king \\nduring his heb-sed jubilee celebrations (see Chapter 2). The \\nstory goes that the complex was designed by the doctor/\\n \\narchitect Imhotep, who was deified much later on in  \\nhistory. It dominated the necropolis of Saqqara for a long  \\ntime, because many later tombs were built around it. \\nDjoser died before his tomb complex was completed. His \\nson and successor Sekhemkhet ruled for such a short time \\nthat a similar tomb complex started by him near that of his father had hardly even begun to take shape when he died.\\nThe identification and order of a number of subsequent \\npharaohs is by no means yet secure; even the location of their tombs is uncertain. Only when we come to Huni, \\nprobably the last pharaoh of this dynasty, do we know a bit \\nmore. What is remarkable about him is that no clear tomb has been found, instead a series of small step pyramids \\nspread over all of Upper Egypt.

This deity would play an important role for sev\\n-\\neral pharaohs of the dynasty. Although we know very little \\nabout their reigns, we do know that they paid just as much \\nattention to building sun temples as to building pyramids. \\nThe first pharaoh of the dynasty was Userkaf, possibly a grandson of Djedefre via another branch of the family. He \\ndivided his resources over two huge construction projects. \\nThis is probably why his pyramid, located just outside the Djoser complex at Saqqara, is of modest dimensions (no \\nmore than 50 metres high) and built of small irregular lime\\n-\\nstone blocks. Userkaf built his sun temple some distance to \\nthe north at Abusir. The temple comprised a platform with \\na large obelisk as a solar symbol on top, and a large valley \\ntemple linked to the obelisk temple by a ceremonial way. His son, Sahure, built his pyramid at Abusir, but does not \\nseem to have built a sun temple. All the pyramids at Abusir \\nare built close together, and it is notable that the royal mor\\n-\\ntuary temples of this dynasty gradually increased in size. Neferirkare, brother and successor to Sahure, returned to \\nthe step pyramid form for his pyramid. The second-last \\nking of the dynasty, Nyusserre, built not only a pyramid Snofru’s three pyramids together have a greater volume than the single gigantic one built by Kheops. The royal \\n \\narchitects had now acquired sufficient know-how to build the pyramid of Snofru’s successor, his son Kheops (the \\nGreek form of his name is Kheops). For this pyramid they \\nchose a new, more northerly location – the desert plateau of Giza near modern-day Cairo. This burial monument was \\nnever surpassed in the entire history of Egypt. The exten\\n-\\nsive complex included a number of long trenches around \\nthe pyramid, some of which still contain the mortuary boats \\nof Lebanese cedar which were to transport Kheops in the  \\nafterlife. Three smaller pyramids close by were intended for \\nKheops’s queens, and a huge field of mastabas was created \\nfor his courtiers literally in the shadow of his pyramid. One \\nof those tombs stands out – a richly furnished underground space for the Queen Mother Hetepheres, but with a com\\n-\\npletely empty alabaster sarcophagus – a mystery that has not yet been solved.\\nOf the reign of Kheops, like that of his father, we only know \\nof a few expeditions to the north-east; both were probably too busy building to worry about other matters. His reign \\nlasted a long time – which was lucky, otherwise the pyra\\n-\\nmid could not have been completed. As far as we know no \\nslaves were employed in the construction, they seem to \\nhave been well-cared-for workmen. Nevertheless, Kheops \\nacquired a reputation later as a bad and cruel ruler, recorded among others by the Greek historian Herodotus in his book \\non Egypt. For example, according to Herodotus Kheops \\n \\nallegedly prostituted his daughter to finance the construc -\\ntion of the pyramid.\\nKheops was succeeded by his son Djedefra for a short time. \\nThe only thing we know of him is that he started to build \\na pyramid at Abu Roash, some kilometres to the north of Giza, of which only the initial stages were completed. \\n \\nHe was succeeded by his brother Khefren (Khephren).

From there,  \\na procession moved up a covered \\nceremonial way towards the mortuary \\ntemple at the base of the pyramid for \\nthe last rites, after which the pharaoh was interred in a burial chamber in or \\nunder the pyramid. in the 4th dynas\\n-\\nty these complexes were not yet  \\ndecorated with texts and reliefs, but \\nin later dynasties this became more \\nand more common, with high quality \\nreliefs everywhere in the complex, \\nnot only in the pyramid.

We know little of his background; he may have been the vizier \\nunder the last king of the previous dynasty. He may not have \\nbeen undisputed in the early part of his reign as he was im\\n-\\nmediately faced with internal unrest and problems on the eastern and southern borders, which he dealt with very \\ncompetently.

The new city, called Itjtawy, has not \\nyet been identified.An important innovation occurred during his reign – in his \\n20th regnal year, he made his successor, the later Sesostris \\nI, co-regent beside him on the throne. This was a sensible move, given the instability of the kingdom in the recent \\npast, and this system was followed by all the pharaohs of \\nthis dynasty, all of whom reigned for relatively long peri\\n-\\nods – which was also good for stability. In later periods, too, the coregency system was sometimes implemented.

They reclaimed this area for agriculture by means of irrigation \\nprojects, and many of them were buried near the Fayum.\\nSesostris I had a prosperous and long reign, despite its \\n \\ndramatic beginning. He concentrated his foreign ambitions mainly on Nubia, building a series of impressive forts deep \\ninto the south – strongholds designed to keep that country \\nunder Egypt’s control. A Nubian tribe was even employed to assist the Egyptians, the Medjay. They were included as \\na separate part of the Egyptian army and also served as a \\nkind of desert police force. A beautiful wooden model of Nubian soldiers from a tomb at Asyut in Middle Egypt bears \\nwitness to this. The Medjay kept their own weapons and \\nburial customs. Their rather unusual graves, known as Pan graves, can be found deep inside Egypt. Independent Nubia, \\ncalled Kush, was forced far to the south, where its centre was \\nthe city of Kerma. When Egypt grew weaker, the Nubians \\n \\nprofited from this and pushed back northwards, up as far as Aswan.\\nSesostris I was also responsible for building the oldest part \\nof the huge Amun temple of Karnak at Thebes.

What \\nmay also have contributed to the success of the Hyksos were \\ntheir better quality bronze weapons, the bows that shot fur\\n-\\nther, and above all the war chariots drawn by horses. Until the arrival of these Asiatics, horses had been a very rare sight \\nin Egypt; however, horses were so important to the Hyksos \\nthat they were buried close to their own tombs. The Hyksos were based at Avaris (today’s Tell el-Dab’a) in the eastern \\nDelta. Their rulers had Semitic names such as Yakub-her \\nand Khyan, and they brought their own culture and reli\\n-\\ngion with them, which not long afterwards began to absorb Egyptian influences. At a certain point in time, the Hyksos \\nrulers even took Egyptian names.\\nFor the native Egyptians, still holding on to power in the south, the presence of the Hyksos was a thorn in their side. \\nBecause the Egyptians did not simply want to give in to the \\npresence of foreign rulers in their country, the Hyksos felt obliged to expand their sphere of influence towards the south.

A nice example of this is \\n \\nthe request by the queen-widow  \\nof Tutankhamun to the king of the Hittites to send her one of his sons \\n \\nto become the successor to the throne.\\nClosely related to this is the phenom\\n-\\nenon of ‘royal incest’. it is not correct \\nto think that incest was common in \\negypt, as is sometimes thought.  \\nThe king was different to ordinary \\nfolk – he functioned as a link be -\\ntween them and the world of the gods so different rules and laws \\n \\napplied to him and his family. The idea was to keep the royal blood \\n \\nas pure as possible without any  \\ncontamination from outside, an idea not unique to egypt.

He changed his own name to Akhenaten (‘Living Spirit of the \\nAten’) and closed down many of the traditional temples \\nin order to make the worship of the Aten compulsory, to the exclusion of all the other gods. Akhenaten was also re\\n-\\nsponsible for wide-ranging artistic advances. The strange way that Akhenaten himself was depicted – a long, narrow \\nface, very feminine breasts and a big belly – has led some to suspect a medical disorder, but DNA research has revealed \\nnothing of the kind. It is possible that it was simply a stylis\\n-\\ntic quirk; it is certainly very different to the delicate style of Amenhotep III’s time. \\nThe prominent position given to his wife Nefertiti is also an \\ninnovation. In many depictions she is on the same scale as the king and plays an equal part in all kinds of events. It is \\nnot clear whether she was a blood relative of Akhenaten or \\nnot. The couple had a number of daughters. He also fathered at least one son, the future Tutankhamun, although prob\\n-\\nably not by Nefertiti but by one of his other wives, Kiya. Re -\\ncent DNA research has ascertained that Akhenaten was the father of Tutankhamun, and that his mother was related to \\nhis father. One important source of information on this pe\\n-\\nriod is the archive of diplomatic correspondence from Asia \\nMinor, found at Amarna. It comprises clay tablets inscribed \\nin cuneiform, Akkadian, the diplomatic language of the \\ntime. They throw interesting light on the foreign relations of Egypt under Akhenaten.

The propaganda \\nmachine of the Egyptian court of course turned it into a ma\\n-\\njor victory, recorded on several temple walls.

Any candidate for the throne could marry her, \\namong other things, to legitimize his claim, and one of \\nthe candidates was a certain Ay, of unknown background.  \\nApparently Ankhesenamun was not very keen on this  \\nmarriage, because she wrote a letter to the king of the  \\nHittites, the major power in the Near East at that time,  \\nasking him to send her one of his sons to marry. We know \\nthat this ploy failed, as she married Ay and he became the \\nnext pharaoh.

His residence \\ncity was Sais in the north-west of the Nile Delta. The  \\nAssyrians, who did not have a permanent military presence \\nin Egypt, relied on local rulers like Necho I to look after their \\ninterests. Necho ruled over Memphis, Sais and Athribis, and \\nwas eventually killed in a battle against the Kushite ruler  \\nTanutamani, who conquered the Nile Delta. In the  \\nperiod 663 to 657 BC, the Assyrian king Assurbanipal  \\nregained control of Egypt down as far as Thebes, thus ending  \\nKushite influence in Egypt. After Necho’s death, his son Psamtek I (Psammetikhos I) was installed by Assurbanipal \\nas a local ruler in the Nile Delta. Assurbanipal himself left \\nEgypt to suppress a revolt back in Assyria.During the absence of the Assyrians, Psamtek slowly ex\\n-\\ntended his influence over the whole Nile Delta. In 658 BC, he entered into a coalition with King Gyges of Lydia (Asia \\nMinor, in what is now Turkey). This mutual support pro\\n-\\ntected both rulers from an invasion by the Assyrians, from \\nwhom they both began to become more independent. The \\nrise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the south of Iraq and \\nof the Persian Empire in Iran caused the Assyrians lots of problems, and preventing them from reconquering Egypt \\nor Lydia. Psamtek conducted campaigns against the Libyan \\nrulers in the west, the same rulers who had been able to gain control of the Lower Egyptian throne during the Third Inter\\n-\\nmediate Period. He also used his army of mercenaries along -\\nside diplomacy to compel the rulers of Upper Egyptian cities and provinces to accept his central authority. Psamtek also \\nentered into allegiances with the rulers of Herakleopolis by \\ngiving them positions in his new kingdom. The situation was rather more complicated in Thebes. During the Third Inter\\n-\\nmediate Period, the high priest of Amun had been ousted as the most important religious figure in Thebes by the ‘God’s \\nwife of Amun’. This office goes back to the Middle Kingdom,\\n \\nbut only became influential during the Third Intermedi -\\nate Period. The god’s wife was a woman who ‘married’ the \\ngod Amun and was his representative on earth. She lived in \\ncelibacy in the Temple of Amun and adopted her successor. \\nUnder Kushite rule, the position was filled by members of the Kushite royal family. Psamtek I was able to arrange for \\nhis daughter Nitocris I to be adopted by the Kushite god’s \\nwife Amenirdis II, thus eclipsing the Kushite influence and adding Thebes to his kingdom. At the same time, he was also \\nable to persuade Montuemhat, an influential Amun priest \\nand also governor of Thebes, to support him.Psamtek not only united Egypt, he also changed the admin\\n-\\nistrative organization of the country. The provinces and their administrators were now made subject to the central \\nauthority, achieved by appointing military commanders \\nwho were loyal to Psamtek.

The Persian \\nconquest resulted in a thin administrative layer being laid \\nover the local administration, headed by a Persian satrap, or \\ngovernor. The Persian administrative layer also introduced a new administrative language, Aramaic. Persian adminis\\n-\\ntrators were also appointed in the provinces (nomes), who ruled with the help of Persian garrisons and levied taxes for \\nthe Persian treasury. In exchange for these taxes, the Egyp\\n-\\ntians could count on their administration, traditions and \\nreligion remaining relatively untouched under Persian rule. \\nThe only office to be abolished by the Persians was that of \\ngod’s wife of Amun. Cambyses’s actions were rather ambig -\\nuous – on the one hand he significantly slashed the income of most of the temples, and on the other he paid extra at\\n-\\ntention to specific temples such as that of Neith at Sais. The Persian king was regarded as the pharaoh and was depicted \\nas such on temple walls. The Persians started major temple \\nconstruction projects, including the Hibis Temple in Kharga\\n \\nOasis.

Sometimes local rulers were able to declare their own authority, and as long as they did not \\nharm Persian interests, they were tolerated by the satrap. After a brief rebellion in 522 BC, Darius I continued the pol\\n-\\nicy followed by his predecessor Cambyses – a subtle Persian \\npresence that could exploit Egypt militarily and economi -\\ncally while leaving Egyptian culture and religion to all in -\\ntents and purposes untouched. Darius also brought Egyptian craftsmen to Persia to work for him there.

This enabled Ptolemy to pay for his wars and also to build a new capital city, Alexandria, which \\ngradually began to take shape. Alexandria was to become \\na Hellenistic cultural centre in the Mediterranean region. Ptolemy initiated the building of the legendary lighthouse \\nand of the Museion, an academic institution of which the \\nfamous library of Alexandria formed part.

He brought \\nthe mummy to Memphis, thus inciting the wrath of Al -\\nexander’s other generals. The mummy of Alexander was an important symbol of power, and its possessor could \\ncall on it to legitimate his position as an heir of Alexander. \\nThus Ptolemy gained power over the satrapy of Egypt. It is \\n \\npossible that Alexander was briefly interred at Saqqara, not far from the Serapeum, the cult centre for the Apis \\nbulls.

Alexander’s other generals, known as diadochi, governed the provinces of the Near East. They \\ncompeted with each other for power and status. One of the \\nways to do this was to gain control of Alexander’s mummy, which is exactly what Ptolemy had done. He had to rebuff a \\nnumber of attacks on Egypt, including one by his old com\\n-\\nrade-in-arms, General Perdiccas, in 321 BC.

Cornelius Gallus invaded the western Nile Delta. \\nAlexandria was unprotected and after the suicides of Mark \\nAntony and Cleopatra fell into Octavian’s hands. He want -\\ned to spare the city because of its beauty and because it had been founded by Alexander the Great. The Roman historian \\nDio Cassius wrote two centuries later that Octavian visited \\nthe tomb of Alexander, who was his role model. This visit gave him the legitimacy to rule Egypt. During his visit to \\nthe tomb, he apparently took over the powers and rights of \\n \\nAlexander. Octavian thus portrayed himself not as the suc -\\ncessor to the Ptolemies, but as the successor of Alexander, \\nand he even refused to visit the tombs of the Ptolemies  \\nbecause he ‘wanted to see kings, not corpses’.Although Octavian only remained a short time in Egypt, he \\nnevertheless introduced some important changes. Close to \\nAlexandria, where his army was bivouacked, he founded a new city, Nikopolis. This city would remain a garrison \\ntown for a long time, undoubtedly to keep control of the \\nfickle Alexandrian inhabitants. He stationed a further two legions in Egypt – one in Babylon, near Memphis, and the \\nother in Luxor in the south. This was undoubtedly related \\nto the administrative reorganization of Egypt. The coun\\n-\\ntry was divided into three (later four) regions, the epist -\\nrategiae: the Nile Delta, Middle Egypt (including the oases of Bahariya and the Fayum) and the Thebaid (the region \\naround Thebes and southern Egypt, including the oases of \\nKharga and Dakhla). Later the Nile Delta would be divided into an eastern and a western part. The epistrategiae were \\neach governed by an epistrategos, a governor. The differ\\n-\\nent epistrategiae were subdivided into a total of about forty  \\nnomes, roughly matching the pharaonic division of Egypt \\ninto forty-two nomes, each with its own capital. A nome \\nwas administered by a strategos. The administration of the \\nsmaller settlements in a nome was in the hands of local of -\\nficials. De epistrategoi were answerable to the praefectus  \\nAegypti, the prefect appointed by the emperor as the high -\\nest official in Egypt and responsible only to him. All of these Roman officials had relatively short periods in office, prob\\n-\\nably to prevent them building up a power base in Egypt that could be used against the emperor.\\nOctavian, who changed his name to Augustus in 27 BC, had \\nbeen given special powers by the Roman Senate in his fight against Mark Antony. Thanks to these he could claim Egypt \\nas his property, even though he governed the province in \\nthe name of the Roman Senate and the Roman people. The special status of Egypt was underlined by Augustus forbid\\n-\\nding any senator visiting Egypt without his permission. In this way he maintained his grip on his private possessions \\nand prevented the riches and strategic position of Egypt be\\n-\\ning used by a potential rival. A good example of this is the \\nfirst prefect of Egypt, C. Cornelius Gallus, who conducted \\nmilitary campaigns against Meroe, a kingdom to the south \\nof Egypt, and recorded his deeds on stelae in temples. He incited the wrath of Augustus and was recalled to Rome, \\nwhere he eventually committed suicide.\\nAugustus introduced the Julian calendar to Egypt, started to mint Roman coins and stimulated trade with more remote \\nregions such as India via the Red Sea harbours, including \\nMyos Hormos and Berenike.

Egypt was also known as the granary of Rome. \\n \\nBecause taxes were often paid in kind, every year huge ships laden with grain left Alexandria for Rome. Their arrival in \\nRome was a special event, and if they were prevented from \\narriving by storms or unrest in Egypt, it could seal the fate of the emperor. Grain from Egypt enabled the ‘bread and \\ngames’ of the Roman emperors. \\nAlthough Augustus initially portrayed himself modestly as the ‘first citizen’ of the Roman Empire, he was actually the \\nsole ruler: caesar. In Egypt they anticipated this by describ\\n-\\ning Augustus in the Oxyrhynkhos Papyri as ‘Caesar, god, \\nson of god’ with the pharaonic regalia. In that role Augustus  \\ninitiated several construction projects in existing temples and ordered new temples to be built. This was one of the \\nways to keep control of a region, for example the Thebaid \\nand the Dodekaschoinos (Nubia).Augustus’s successor, Tiberius, continued this policy.

Although egypt \\nwas an important province, the resi -\\ndence of the roman emperors was initially in rome and then in Constan\\n-\\ntinople. They were not generally wor -\\nshipped as gods, unlike the ptolem-ies, but did act as the link between \\nhumans and the gods – and were \\nthus demigods. The roman emperor was only depicted as pharaoh on the \\nwalls of the temples, where he wore \\ntraditional costume and performed the traditional roles – offering to the \\ngods and crushing the enemies of \\negypt with a mace. The only major change in the roman period was \\n \\nvisible in the titulary of the depicted emperor. Traditionally, a pharaoh had \\nfive names – his Horus name, his He \\nof the Two ladies name, his Golden Horus name, his throne name and his \\nbirth name. in the roman period, the \\nHe of the Two ladies name and the Golden Horus name were dropped. \\nThe throne name comprised the \\nword ‘caesar’ meaning ‘emperor’ \\n \\nand the birth name the name of the emperor plus the egyptian word for \\n \\nsebastos (augustus): ‘the one who is sacred’. \\nAugustus legitimized his rule in \\negypt by claiming that he had suc\\n-\\nceeded to the throne of Alexander the Great while visiting his tomb in \\nAlexandria. At first, for political rea\\n-\\nsons, Augustus did not want to be \\ndepicted as the demigod pharaoh, \\nbecause the senate would immedi -\\nately have turned against him. in \\nsome temples though, for example \\nthose at Kalabsha and dendera, he \\nwas depicted as pharaoh in his first year, but generally this occurred much later in his reign. The emperors \\nwho followed Augustus frequently \\nused propaganda to legitimize their rule in egypt. For example, they \\nclaimed that they were descended \\nfrom the gods through a divine birth. This was depicted in the mammisis \\nbuilt next to the temples, for exam\\n-\\nple that in dendera, built by nero or \\nTrajan. The building and expanding \\nof temples was one of the ways the \\nroman emperors used to legitimize their rule, as well as a means to keep \\ncontrol of the priesthoods and thus \\nindirectly the local populace.

In \\n630, the followers of Islam, the Muslims, conquered Mecca \\nand then began a quick dissemination of the new religion. The first followers of the prophet brought the Arabian Pen\\n-\\ninsula under the control of a single leader. Caliph Umar con -\\nquered Jerusalem and Damascus, and defeated the Sassanids in the east. Under his leadership, Egypt was wrested from \\nByzantine control in 641. Headed by General ’Amr ibn el-As, \\nan army of four thousand soldiers entered Egypt where they engaged in battle with the Byzantines near Heliopolis. They \\nthen marched to the Roman-Byzantine fort of Babylon, \\nnear the ancient capital Memphis, and on to the Byzantine capital in Egypt, Alexandria. The Egyptians had long been \\nconsidered heretic Christians, since the schism from the \\nByzantine Church in Constantinople, and they had suffered under the taxes imposed by the Byzantines to finance their \\nwars against the Sassanids. This explains why the Egyptians \\noften cooperated with the Muslims, in the hope that they would exploit them less than the Byzantines. As a result, the \\nMuslims did not meet much resistance. Once Byzantine at\\n-\\ntempts to reconquer Egypt had failed, a treaty was signed in \\n641 stating that the Byzantines would leave Egypt. \\nThe Muslims founded a new Egyptian capital just to the \\nnorth of the fort of Babylon, El-Fustat, a city that would later be absorbed by the Cairo of today. The Rashiduns, the \\nfirst four caliphs – called the ‘successors’ after the death of \\nMuhammad in 632 – were followed by fourteen Ummayad caliphs. The last Rashidun caliph – Ali, Mohammad’s cous\\n-\\nin – was murdered, resulting in the birth of the two great ideological movements in Islam, Shi’ite – the followers of \\nAli – and Sunni – the followers of Orthodox Islam. Under \\nthe Rashidun and the Ummayad caliphs, who ruled from Damascus from 661 to 750, Egypt was administered by a \\n \\ngovernor who collected taxes for the caliph. The first gov -\\nernor was ’Amr ibn el-As, who initially took over the Byz -\\nantine administrative system – this system would not be reorganized until the 8th century. He appointed a supreme commander in Egypt, as well as a supreme judge (qadi) and \\na minister of finance. Taxes were levied on agricultural land, \\nand grain was shipped via the Ptolemaic-Roman canal be\\n-\\ntween the Red Sea and the Nile to the Islamic homeland, the Hejaz, the western part of Saudi Arabia, bordering on \\nthe Red Sea. After ’Amr ibn el-As, the Ummayad caliphs \\nappointed governors who alternated between being severe on and well-inclined towards the Egyptian population. In \\nsome periods the Christians and Jews were suppressed. \\nGradually, more and more Muslim migrants from the East settled in Egypt, speeding up the process of Islamization. A \\nnumber of other measures also contributed to this; for ex\\n-\\nample, under the Ummayad caliphs, Coptic was replaced as \\nthe official language of the administration by Arabic, and the \\ncoins were from then on minted in Damascus, the capital of \\nthe Ummayad Empire.

Under the British governor \\nLord Cromer Egypt became economically and administra\\n-\\ntively stronger, and he also improved the efficiency of the agricultural practices. However, the Egyptians themselves \\nwere treated as second-rate citizens. This led increasingly \\nto resistance from the 1890s on. When the First World War broke out, Egypt was separated from the Ottoman Empire \\nby the British. They fought the Ottomans from Egypt and \\nsecured their interests in Asia by controlling the Suez Canal. During this war, the Egyptians were encouraged to choose \\nthe British side, and they were promised independence if \\nthey did so. However, this promise was never kept, and thus the British created a climate that promoted nationalism. \\nAfter the First World War, nationalists like Sa’ad Zaghloul \\nnegotiated in Europe for Egyptian independence.

By cooperating with the ulama, the scholars from the Al-Azhar mosque, the most important Islamic religious \\nstudy centre in Cairo, Napoleon hoped to win the popula\\n-\\ntion to his side. Growing dissatisfaction with the French \\npresence, the continually escaping Mameluke leaders ravag -\\ning the south of Egypt and the combined English-Ottoman attacks to repulse the French eventually resulted in the \\nFrench having to leave Egypt after only three years. \\nWhat followed was a struggle between the British, the Ot\\n-\\ntomans and the Mamelukes about who should become governor of Egypt. During this period of chaos, the ulama \\nturned to the only one who appeared to have a vision, Mu\\n-\\nhammed Ali, an Albanian-Ottoman army commander and \\na veteran of the fight against Napoleon. Muhammed Ali \\nbecame pasha of Egypt in name, and thus paid taxes to the \\nOttoman sultan in Istanbul. He consolidated his power in 1811 by killing the last Mameluke leaders, and started to in\\n-\\ndustrialize Egypt as quickly as he could. The country also got its own professional army, consisting of Egyptians for \\nthe first time since the Late Period. Not only the army be\\n-\\ncame Egyptian, the administration and government appara -\\ntus also increasingly became run by Egyptians. Huge textile \\nfactories were set up in Egypt and the Egyptian railway was \\nbuilt. Although not all of these developments were success -\\nful, Muhammed Ali ‘Egyptianized’ the country. His succes -\\nsors – who called themselves ‘sultan’ from 1914 onwards – \\ncontinued his policies. One of these projects was the Suez \\nCanal, which opened in 1869, a modern variant of the canal \\nfrom the Red Sea to the Nile, which made the journey by sea around Africa redundant. \\nHowever, in order to maintain this rate of development, the \\nsuccessors of Muhammed Ali borrowed heavily from Brit\\n-\\nain.

The study of Egypt in the Renaissance was mainly through \\ndocuments dating to the Roman Period. In 1505, for exam\\n-\\nple, Hieroglyphica was published, an article in Greek about \\nthe hieroglyphs by the Alexandrian scholar Horapollo, who probably lived in the 4th or 5th century AD. Another im\\n-\\nportant document was found in Macedonia in 1460 – the \\nCorpus Hermeticum. This was a collection of Greek mythi -\\ncal and mystical texts, which according to tradition had been written down by the mythical figure Hermes Trismegistus, \\nalso known as Hermes or the ancient Egyptian god Thoth. \\nThe early scholars also looked at the Egyptian monuments that had been brought to Rome by the Romans, including \\nthe obelisks in the Piazza di Porta San Giovanni and St Pe\\n-\\nter’s Square, the sphinxes in the Iseum Campense, and in \\nPompei at the stelae and shabtis. The two best known schol -\\nars are the priest Piero Valeriano (1477-1558) and the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), mentioned above. Both \\nwrote many articles about the hieroglyphs. Valeriano’s work \\nwas for a long time the standard work for the study of these characters and was a sort of summary of all the knowledge of \\nthem at that time. Kircher believed that the hieroglyphs had \\nsymbolic value and mystical meaning. He studied Coptic, the latest phase of the Egyptian language, and was the first to \\ncorrectly suppose that it was descended from hieroglyphs. \\nHe tried to decipher the hieroglyphs through Coptic, and he considered himself successful, whereas in fact he was \\nnot. Kircher based his work mainly on the Bembine Tablet, \\nor Isiac Tablet, a bronze tablet (probably Roman) with hi\\n-\\neroglyphs which he deciphered, but which are now known to be nonsense.

Students of Champollion set up new degree programmes in Germany, France and Italy. \\nScholars such as Karl Lepsius and Emmanuel De Rougé con\\n-\\ntinued to expand on Champollion’s work and taught at the \\nuniversities of Berlin and Paris, respectively. The academic \\ndiscipline of Egyptology spread across Germany to Jena, \\nLeipzig and Bonn.Until the 1880s, research and teaching continued to concen\\n-\\ntrate on inscribed objects. From that time on, archaeologists together collections of antiquities and sold them to the high -\\nest bidder. Often they were the huge national museums in Europe.

After Islam arrived \\nin Egypt, the ancient Egyptian culture mainly interested Is\\n-\\nlamic scholars, alchemists and mystics in search of hidden knowledge. In Europe, the interest was mainly in Coptic \\nhistory as part of the Christian heritage. \\nThe study of Classical Rome during the Renaissance drew attention to the Egyptian elements there. People were fa\\n-\\nmiliar with Egypt, despite few having ever been there. Later on, the obelisk and the sphinx were incorporated into archi\\n-\\ntectural decoration and into objects like clocks. From about 1730, tombs and mausoleums began to display Egyptianiz\\n-\\ning decorative motifs, and so did gardens. The first collec -\\ntors added Egyptian objects to their collections – mummies and inscribed objects such as scarabs and sculptures were \\nparticularly popular. The tales of the travellers and adven\\n-\\nturers who went to Egypt increased this interest. Various \\npaintings and drawings were made with mystical illustra -\\ntions of Egypt, and Egyptianizing elements even found their way into dinner services and architecture. Soon it was no \\nlonger simply a fashion but a generally accepted view that \\nthe Egyptian culture was important. The expedition led by Napeoleon, the publication of the \\nDescription de l’Egypte and the decipherment of the hiero\\n-\\nglyphs triggered the true Egyptomania.

This can \\nbe seen in the architecture of administrative and legal build -\\nings in the west, which were given Egyptianizing elements, one example being the state prison in Trenton, New Jersey, \\nUSA. \\nEgyptomania was closely linked to the study of ancient Egypt, to Egyptology and archaeology. At times when Egypt-\\nology was in a difficult position, for example if there was \\n \\nlittle money for excavations, scholars would rekindle an in -\\nterest in the general public by writing novels and attractive \\ninformative books, and by organizing exhibitions. Egypto -\\nmania was also regularly stimulated by major archaeological discoveries, for example the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, Ancient egypt remains extremely popular in comic books, \\nthe cosmetics industry, the toy industry and many other \\nmanifestations.',\n",

It was originally called the Netherlands \\nInstitute for Archaeology and Arabic Studies and only rep -\\nresented Dutch universities. Currently eight Dutch and \\nFlemish universities participate in the NVIC, with the aim \\nof stimulating and propagating their teaching and research \\nactivities in the Middle East. \\nThe Netherlands-Flemish Institute in Cairo is an academic \\ncentre that provides services to staff and students of the participating universities. These activities primarily relate \\nto Arabic and Islamic Studies, Egyptology, Archaeology and \\nPapyrology, although the NVIC also facilitates the univer\\n-\\nsities in other disciplines and represents them in a general sense. \\nBoth the staff of the institute and the research fellows con\\n-\\nduct their work on behalf of the participating universities. \\nThe NVIC regularly organizes symposia in the fields related \\nto its expertise, and it also organizes courses in the archae -\\nology of Egypt and Arabic Studies at academic level as an \\nintegral part of the BA and MA degree programmes of the \\nDutch and Flemish universities. These courses concentrate on practical knowledge and academic experience in Egypt, \\nand thus contribute significantly to both fields at the partici -\\npating universities.
