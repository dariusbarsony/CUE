# CUE

repository for the creative user empowerment master's AI thesis at the Allard Pierson Museum. Repo used for thesis on linking exhibitoin catalogs to metadata entries using various models that create embeddings. 

Introduction into the notebooks in code/notebooks: 

code/notebooks/data_epxloration.ipynb: This notebook explores the data an makes a short effort into extracting the labels (illustration credits page of the exhibition catalog).
code/notebooks/data_mining.ipynb: extracts the records mentioned in Eternal Egypt, using sparql queries on the UvA LOD database.
code/notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb: preprocesses the book pages and metadata. 
code/notebooks/learning_to_rank.ipynb: short effort into constructing a ranker (DRAFT)
code/notebooks/models(1).ipynb: The main experiments conducted using Eternal Egypt as an early pilot. 

All data is private, contact me if you need any datasets and I will consult with the museum. Metadata is publicly available so this can be retrieved from either: https://uba.uva.nl/en/support/open-data/data-sets-and-publication-channels/data-sets-and-publication-channels.html or LOD platform: https://lod.uba.uva.nl/UB-UVA/Catalogue/
